We thank the referee for her enthusiastm and useful remarks.

The time correlation
between the laser pulses and the electrometer is described in section 2.4. We
also made sure that the digital analyser used is mentioned both in the section
concerning the photodiode and the section concerning the solar cell.

We included text in section 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 to clarify the dark current
measurement procedure.
