\section{StarDICE response}
\label{sec:rsd}

In this section, we will show the methodology to obtain the \SD telescope response $\Rtel(\lambda)$ by analyzing \SD camera data.

\subsection{Data set description}
\label{sec:sd_datadesc}

As described in section \ref{sec:cbp_datadesc}, the laser emits pulses at a rate of \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz} in bursts that are separated with dark times. Figure~\ref{fig:ghost_contrast} shows a stack of images obtained when the CBP shoots in the \SD CCD camera for two wavelength datasets. 

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Stack of images at different wavelengths, with one image per nanometer. \textit{Left:} Stack of images between \SI{350}{\nano\meter} and \SI{450}{\nano\meter}. The scale is set on the ZScale from IRAF to make faint features visible. The spot of interest $G_0$ is at the center, and the ghost reflections are at its left. The circles correspond to the aperture photometry at different radii, when an annulus contains ghost contribution, it is colored with respect to the order of the ghost. The red area around the 1$\up{st}$ order ghost represents the area where the photometry of the ghost is measured. \textit{Right:} Same image but for a stack of images between \SI{1000}{\nano\meter} and \SI{1100}{\nano\meter}. We note that the 2$\up{nd}$ order ghost is not visible for the stack in the UV, where the 1$\up{st}$ order is maximal, while it is visible in the IR, where the 1$\up{st}$ order is lower. For the stack in IR, we osberve a degradation of the \SD PSF.}

In this section, we develop a modelization of the \spinhole pinhole data, considering that the \SD telescope PSF can be modelized as a Moffat distribution \citep{moffat} $M(r, \lambda)$ which depends on the radius $r$ and the wavelength $\lambda$ as:

\begin{equation}
M(r, \lambda)= 1 - \left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha(\lambda)^2} \right)^{1-\beta(\lambda)},
\end{equation}
with $\alpha(\lambda)$ and $\beta(\lambda)$ the parameters of the Moffat distribution. The flux $F(r, \lambda)$ measured in the CCD with aperture photometry, can be modelized as: 

%Thus, the core of the spot in the CCD is the convolution of the PSF, the CBP output shape, and ghosts from light reflections between the glass before the CCD and the CCD itself, as schematized in Figure~\ref{fig:schema_ghost}. These contributions make the core of the spot complex to model. However the tail of the PSF should not be impacted by the contribution of the CBP output shape and the light diffusion, so it is expected to behave like a Moffat distribution. 

\begin{equation}
F(r, \lambda) = A(\lambda) \times \frac{M(r, \lambda) + \Kghostfit(r, \lambda)}{1 + \Kghostfit(r \rightarrow +\infty, \lambda)} + \bkg(r, \lambda),
\label{eq:moffat_model}
\end{equation}
with $A(\lambda)$ the total amplitude, $\Kghostfit(r, \lambda) = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} G_n(\lambda)}{A(\lambda)}$ the relative contribution of the sum of all the ghosts $G_n(\lambda)$ and $\bkg(r, \lambda)$ the contribution of the background. The origin of the ghost contribution is schematized in Figure~\ref{fig:schema_ghost}.

The fit is done with PSF photometry for a radius $r=\SI{20.9}{pixels}$, and then for successive annulus of external radius from \SI{24.9}{pixels} to \SI{419.1}{pixels}. These radii are regularly spaced on a logarithm scale shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ghost_contrast}. The parameters of the fit are adjusted with the \spinhole pinhole dataset No.~8 from Table~\ref{tab:schedule}, with one image per wavelength. To take into account $\Kghostfit(r, \lambda)$, an additive value is fitted for every annulus that contains a ghost contribution. The evolution of the Moffat distribution is expected to be smooth with respect to wavelength, so the parameters $\alpha(\lambda)$ and $\beta(\lambda)$ are developed on a B-spline basis with 15 wavelength nodes regularly spaced between \SI{350}{\nano\meter} to \SI{1100}{\nano\meter}. The same goes for the function $\Kghostfit(r, \lambda)$ as it corresponds to light reflections on surfaces in the optical path. The results of this fit are shown Figure~\ref{fig:result_params}. 

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig/schema_ghost.pdf}
    \caption{Schematic of the light reflections that generate the ghosts, which are defocused and less intense images at other positions in the focal plane.

The $\alpha(\lambda)$ and $\beta(\lambda)$ parameters of the PSF are stable within \SI{350}{\nano\meter} and \SI{900}{\nano\meter}, and change significantly beyond. This is correlated with a change of the PSF shape in the infrared as can be seen in the image stacks in Figure~\ref{fig:ghost_contrast}. The third panel shows a constant background against wavelength, with a mean of \SI{0.267}{ADU/pixel} for an exposure time of \SI{1.1}{\second}. This panel shows also the result of a study over dark images, detailed in Section~\ref{sec:bkg}. The fourth panel presents the relative contribution of the first order ghost $G_1(\lambda)$, $\Kghostfitfirst(\lambda) = \frac{G_1(\lambda)}{A(\lambda)}$ in percent, superimposed with the fraction $\Kghost=\frac{G_1(\lambda)}{G_0(\lambda)}$ obtained by photometry measurements on the first order ghost $G_1(\lambda)$ and the main spot $G_0(\lambda)$. This study is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:ghost}, and shows that the two ratios share the same behaviour below \SI{900}{\nano\meter}. The reduced chi-squared of the fit in the fifth panel reach a value close to 1 at every wavelength, which indicates that the model satisfactorily describes the dataset.

\subsection{Photometry for filter throughput measurement}
\label{sec:photometry_small}

The modelization of the PSF at long distance from its core is possible because of the laboratory conditions of these images. These conditions are intrisinc to CBP images, with an isolated source and no sky background. It is impossible to port this method with on-sky data. We choose to carry out the whole analysis with aperture photometry and a background estimation reproducible with on-sky data. This method described in Section~\ref{sec:photometry_small} is the baseline photometry for the \spinhole pinhole. Then we will compare the results obtained with this method and the fitted parameters to quantify eventual biases of the baseline photometry.

Figure~\ref{fig:ccd_examples} shows examples of images obtained when the CBP shoots in the \SD CCD camera with two different pinholes. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig/ccd_examples.pdf}
    \caption{Examples of images obtained when the CBP shoots in the \SD telescope at $\lambda_L=\SI{450}{\nm}$ with the \bpinhole pinhole on the right and \spinhole pinhole on the left. The ghost reflection is visible for both images at the left of the main spot. In the \bpinhole pinhole image, a large annulus around the main spot is visible, and correspond to light diffusion around a mechanical iris at the input of the CBP.}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Overscan subtraction}

Firstly, we need to subtract the overscan in every image. The mean of each column $i$ of the horizontal overscan and each row $j$ of the vertical overscan is computed. For each pixel $(i, j)$, we subtract the sum of estimation of the overscan estimated on the column $i$ and the row $j$.
Then, aperture photometry is performed to measure the quantity of photons collected in the \SD camera images. This requires a background subtraction, and two differents methods are used depending on the pinhole.

\subsubsection{Background subtraction}
\label{sec:bkg}

\textbf{75~µm pinhole} \\

To estimate the background contribution, the sources in the image need to be detected and masked. We compute the standard deviation of an image $\sigma$, and every pixel with a signal higher than 5$\sigma$ is masked, as well as all the surrounding pixels that has a signal higher than 2$\sigma$. Then we proceed to a segmentation of the masked image into boxes of $129\times132$ pixels. We compute the mean and the standard deviation of the background in each of these boxes, and we interpolate their values in a 2D map to get our estimation of the background. This background estimation is subtracted to the image. Then, the centroid of the spot of interest is computed to pursue aperture photometry at this position. $\Qccd$ is measured with aperture photometry at a radius of \SI{20.9}{pixels} for every image of the dataset with the \spinhole.

As shown in the third panel of Figure~\ref{fig:result_params}, the mean background fitted is $\mu_\mathrm{bkg, fitted}=\SI{0.267}{ADU/pixel}$ with a standard deviation of $\sigma_\mathrm{bkg}=\SI{0.059}{ADU/pixel}$. On the other hand, two datasets of dark images have been studied. Firstly dark images with the laser turned off, and secondly dark images when masking the CBP output with a cap from dataset No.~9 in Table~\ref{tab:schedule}. Both datasets are constants in time and wavelength, and their mean value of ADU/pixel are compatible. We combine it into one dataset of darks and compute their mean $\mu_\mathrm{dark, photometry}=\SI{0.252}{ADU/pixel}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_\mathrm{dark, photometry}=\SI{0.059}{ADU/pixel}$. The result is visible in the third panel of Figure~\ref{fig:result_params}. We conclude that the estimation of the background with the fit is consistent with the dark datasets results. \\

\textbf{5~mm pinhole} \\

When using \bpinhole pinhole, the main spot takes a significant area of the focal plane, meaning there is not enough background in the image to reconstruct it. The background is measured with dark exposures with the dark datasets mentioned above, and the spatial mean of all these dark images is computed to obtain a master dark. The background contribution is estimated by aperture photometry in the master dark at the same position and same radius than the laser-on images. $\Qccd^{\bpinhole}$ is measured with aperture photometry, after background subtraction. The optimal radius is evaluated at 300 pixels for the \bpinhole pinhole in order to contain the main spot and the 1\up{st} order ghost. We could have increased the radius to contain the iris flux, but it would have added as much noise as the signal gained. 

\subsubsection{Correction of the light contamination}\label{sec:sd_contaminations}

When measuring the flux collected from the \SD camera, we have to remove light contaminations described in Sections~\ref{sec:532_cont} and~\ref{sec:fluorescence}. As the photodiode and the solar cell, the total signal measured in the \SD camera $\Qccdmes$ is the sum of the flux from the main laser line $\Qccdcal$ and the flux from the \SI{532}{\nm} contamination $\Qccd^{532}$, the $\lambda_{\rm comp}$ contamination $\Qccd^{\lambda_{\rm comp}}$, and the integrating sphere fluorescence $\Qccd^{\mathrm{fluo}}$, as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \Qccdmes = \Qccdcal + \Qccd^{532} + \Qccd^{\lambda_{\rm comp}} + \Qccd^{\mathrm{fluo}}
    \label{eq:qccd_mes}
\end{equation}

The contamination light in the \SD camera can be estimated by multiplying $\Qphot^{532}$, $\Qphot^{\lambda_{\rm comp}}$ and $\Qphot^{\mathrm{fluo}}$ by $\Rcbp(\lambda)$ and $\Rtel(\lambda)$. The contaminations are subtracted, and impact on filter transmission measurement is shown Figure~\ref{fig:g_filter_532}, focusing on the \SD g filter, the most affected filter by integrating sphere fluorescence and \SI{532}{\nano\meter} line.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{\SD g filter transmission as a function of the set laser wavelength $\lambda_L$, with and without the \SI{532}{\nm} and fluorescence correction.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{$G_1$ photometry}
\label{sec:ghost}

Let be $G_0(\lambda)$ the quantity of light collected in the main spot, and $G_\mathrm{n}(\lambda)$ the quantity of light collected in the ghost of order $n$. The ratio of the 1\up{st} order ghost $G_1(\lambda)$ over the main spot $G_0(\lambda)$ is:

\begin{equation}
    \Kghost = \frac{G_1(\lambda)}{G_0(\lambda)}.
    \label{eq:ratio_ghost}
\end{equation}

We measure $G_1(\lambda)$ with the \spinhole pinhole where it is well separated from $G_0(\lambda)$. We build a mask with the expected ghost shape like shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ghost_contrast}, and we fit its best position on the image. To estimate the background at this position, we assume that the main spot has a spatial vertical symmetry, and measure the flux contained in a symmetric mask at the vertical symmetric position from the main spot. Then, $G_1(\lambda)$ is the sum of the ADUs in the ghost mask after background subtraction. On the other hand, $G_0(\lambda)$ is measured with the baseline photometry. This study is pursued for the 3 runs of dataset No.~4, and 2 runs of dataset No.~2 from Table~\ref{tab:schedule}. The results obtained for $\Kghost$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ghost_ratio}. 

The ratio $\Kghost$ and $\Kghostfitfirst$ obtained with two different methods are superimposing well below \SI{950}{\nano\meter} in the third panel of Figure~\ref{fig:result_params}, which gives us confidence about the accuracy of this measurement. Above \SI{950}{\nano\meter} the PSF is deteriorating and starts to overflow in the ghost mask, plus there are interference fringes appearing in the focal plane. These issues can explain the deviation between the two measurements at these wavelengths. The fit result gives more confidence in its accuracy because it accounts for the PSF evolution.

\begin{figure}[h]
     \centering
     \resizebox{\hsize}{!}{\includegraphics{fig/ghost_ratio.pdf}}
     \caption{Ratio $\Kghost$ with respect to $\lambda_L$. The mean spline goes through the five datasets.}
     \label{fig:ghost_ratio}
    %~/stardice/analysis/cbp_paper/golden_sample_analysis/dr2/ghost_photometry_general.ipynb
\end{figure}

Further investigation indicates that the ghosts of higher order $G_{n>1}$ should contribute for less than $0.1\%$ of $G_0(\lambda)$. Yet, a second order ghost is visible for the stack in infrared in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:ghost_contrast}. The reflectivities of the window and the CCD cannot explain this phenomenon, so it has necessarily went through another optical path. The infrared light could have gone through the CCD and reflect in the back of it before being collected.

\subsubsection{Aperture correction}

In this section, we aim to quantify the fraction of flux missed when measuring the signal for a \spinhole pinhole image with aperture photometry rather than with the PSF photometry. The fraction of flux missed by aperture photometry compared to the total amplitude $A$ is quantified in Figure~\ref{fig:bias_aperture}. Less than 3\% of the flux is missed between \SI{400}{\nano\meter} and \SI{900}{\nano\meter}. Below \SI{400}{\nano\meter} the ghost contribution is missed when using an aperture of \SI{20.9}{pixels}. Above \SI{900}{\nano\meter} where the PSF is degrading, the fraction of flux missed increase by one order of magnitude and reach more than 75\%. The bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:bias_aperture} shows that the baseline photometry is compatible to the fit estimation at less than 0.2\% between \SI{400}{\nano\meter} and \SI{900}{\nano\meter}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
     \centering
     \resizebox{\hsize}{!}{\includegraphics{fig/bias_aperture.pdf}}
     \caption{\textit{Top:} Fraction of missing flux against $\lambda_L$ when measuring \spinhole pinhole dataset with aperture photometry at \SI{20.9}{pixels} rather than taking the total amplitude $A$ fitted. The red curve corresponds to the estimation of the fit, the green one to aperture photometry when the backgruond is estimate with the dark datasets, and the blue one to aperture photometry when the background is estimate with the method described in Section~\ref{sec:photometry_small}. \textit{Bottom:} Relative difference in percent between the flux measured for aperture photometry with the two background estimations and the model estimation at \SI{20.9}{pixels}.}
     \label{fig:bias_aperture}
    %~/stardice/analysis/cbp_paper/total_fluxes/fit_results.ipynb
\end{figure}

We can reach the conclusion that the baseline aperture photometry for the \spinhole pinhole can be used for the range between \SI{400}{\nano\meter} and \SI{900}{\nano\meter}. Below \SI{400}{\nano\meter} there is a need to take care of the ghost contribution. Above \SI{900}{\nano\meter}, this method does not measure a representative flux of the target. It is believed that the \SD telescope is the one responsible for the PSF degradation, one possible explanation is that the primary mirror is becoming partially transparent and generate defocused light. Anyhow, the CBP measurements cannot be trusted in this wavelength range. 

\subsubsection{Pinhole intercalibration}

It is necessary to intercalibrate the \SD response measurements obtained with the \spinhole pinhole with the CBP response measurements obtained with the \bpinhole pinhole. To link these measurements, we measure the difference between \SD responses with the \spinhole pinhole and the \bpinhole pinhole. When shooting with the \bpinhole pinhole, the main spot is a pointlike source, hence the data reduction of $\Qccd^{\bpinhole}$ is different than the baseline photometry.

To compare the \SD responses for both pinhole, we need to measure the fluxes with aperture photometry at the same radius. Thus both apertures contain the same features, such as the ghost contribution. This way there is no other consideration than the geometry of the pinholes. We estimate the \spinhole pinhole flux $F(300, \lambda)$, $\Qccd^{\bpinhole}$ with the method described in Section~\ref{sec:photometry_big}. We compute the ratio $\Kpinholes=\frac{F(300)}{\Qccd^{\bpinhole}}$ and show the result in Figure~\ref{fig:ratio_pinholes}. The linear fit of this ratio is used to intercalibrate the \bpinhole pinhole $\Rcbp(\lambda)$ obtained and the \spinhole pinhole \SD for every measurements of this analysis.

%The non-null slope and not expected as the ratio between the two pinholes should corresponds only to the ratio of surfaces of illuminated area at the input CBP. We suspect that some light diffusion on the edges of the pinholes or other complex reflections in the setup could give this ratio a chromatic dependance.


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig/ratio_pinholes.pdf}
    \caption{Ratio $\Kpinholes$ with respect to wavelength. The black line corresponds to a linear fit between \SI{400}{\nm} and \SI{900}{\nm}.}
    \label{fig:ratio_pinholes}
    %~/stardice/analysis/cbp_paper/total_fluxes/ratio_pinholes.ipynb
\end{figure}

% The bottom panel corresponds to the aperture correction that is needed to apply to the aperture photometry measurement. It is around 2\% below \SI{950}{\nano\meter}, and increase by one order of magnitude in the infrared. This increase is correlated with the variation of the Moffat parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, showing that the PSF is drastically changing in the near infrared. This issue is discussed in more details section \ref{sec:ir}. The third panel show a constant background against wavelength, at a mean of \SI{0.27}{ADU/pixel}.

%\subsection{Correction of the ghost contamination}
%\label{sec:ghost}
%
%In Section~\ref{sec:strategy} we discussed the need to intercalibrate the CBP response for both pinhole sizes. To this purpose, we took measurements with the \SD telescope with both \bpinhole pinhole and \spinhole pinhole, and evaluate the systematic related to this change of pinhole diameter. One major difference between the \spinhole pinhole and the \bpinhole pinhole is how the ghost and the main spot superimpose on the focal plane. We show in Figure~\ref{fig:schema_ghost} the optical path that produces the 1\up{st} order ghost on the focal plane. In Figure~\ref{fig:ghost_contrast}, we can see an image of the 1\up{st} order ghost next to the main spot obtained with the \spinhole pinhole. The distance between the centroïd of the main spot and the centroïd of the 1\up{st} order ghost is between 30 to 70 pixels depending on the radial position on the mirror. In the mean time, the \bpinhole pinhole photometry is made with an aperture of 300 pixels, containing the 1\up{st} order ghost and the main spot. We need to know the fraction of the flux that corresponds to the 1\up{st} order ghost.
%
%
%\subsubsection{First order ghost photometry}
%
%We want to quantify the contribution of the ghost relatively to the main spot for the \bpinhole pinhole. Let be $G_0(\lambda)$ the quantity of light collected in the main spot, and $G_\mathrm{n}(\lambda)$ the quantity of light collected in the ghost of order $n$. We define $\Kghost(\lambda)$ the ratio of the 1\up{st} order ghost $G_1(\lambda)$ over the main spot $G_0(\lambda)$:
%
%\begin{equation}
%    \Kghost = \frac{G_1(\lambda)}{G_0(\lambda)}.
%    \label{eq:ratio_ghost}
%\end{equation}
%We make the hypothesis that the ratio $\Kghost(\lambda)$ is the same for both pinholes. We measure $G_1(\lambda)$ with the \spinhole pinhole where it is well separated from $G_0(\lambda)$. We build a mask with the expected ghost shape and we fit its best position on the image. $G_1(\lambda)$ is the sum of the ADUs contained in this mask, after background subtraction. To estimate the background at this position, we assume that the main spot has a spatial vertical symmetry. We place a symmetric mask at the vertical symmetric position and measure the ADUs contained inside, which correspond to background only. This background is subtracted to the photometry of the 1\up{st} order ghost to obtain $G_1(\lambda)$. On the other hand, $G_0(\lambda)$ is measured with the aperture photometry described in \ref{sec:photometry}.

All responses are at the same position on the focal plane.}

% 
% 
% \subsubsection{Contribution of the n\up{th} order ghosts}
%
%Now that we did the photometry for the first order ghost, we want to estimate the contribution of higher orders. Since the intensity of these ghosts is very weak and hard to analyse, we simulate their contribution from the $1^{\mathrm{st}}$ order ghost analysis. Let be $\Rwindow$ the reflection coefficient at the interface air-window, and $\Rccd$ the reflection coefficient at the interface air-CCD. We know the transmission of the window $T_\mathrm{window}(\lambda)$ from manufacturer datasheets, so we can infer $\Rwindow$:
% 
%\begin{equation}
%    \Rwindow = 1 - T_\mathrm{window}(\lambda).
%    \label{eq:rwindow}
%\end{equation}
% 
%\noindent We define $F$ the flux collected by the camera, $G_0(\lambda)$ the quantity of light collected in the main spot, and $G_\mathrm{n}(\lambda)$ the quantity of light collected in the ghost of order $n$. $G_0(\lambda)$ and $G_\mathrm{n}(\lambda)$ are a function of F: 
%
%\begin{equation}
%     G_0(\lambda) = (1-\Rwindow)^{2} \times (1-\Rccd) \times F, 
%     \label{eq:g0}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned}
%    G_\mathrm{n}(\lambda) & = G_{0}(\lambda) \times [\Rccd \Rwindow + \Rccd(1-\Rwindow)\Rwindow]^{n} \\
%    & = G_{0}(\lambda) \times [2 \Rccd \Rwindow - \Rccd \Rwindow^{2}] ^{n}. \\
%     \label{eq:gn}
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%
%\noindent The sum of all the ghosts $G_{\mathrm{n>0}}(\lambda)$ is defined as
%\footnote{If |q| < 1, the serie $\left( \sum_{n=0}^{m} q^n \right)_{\mathrm{m \in \mathbb{N}}}$ strictly converge and \\ $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} q^n \equiv \lim\limits_{m \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=0}^{m} q^n = \frac{1}{1-q}$}:
%
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
%     G_{n>0}(\lambda)&=\sum_{n=0}^{\mathrm{n} \rightarrow \infty} G_\mathrm{n}(\lambda) - G_0(\lambda) \\
%     & = G_0(\lambda) \times \sum_{n=0}^{n \rightarrow \infty} \left( [2 \Rccd \Rwindow - \Rccd \Rwindow^{2}] ^{n} - G_0(\lambda) \right)\\
%     & = G_0(\lambda) \times\left( \frac{1}{1- [2 \Rccd \Rwindow - \Rccd \Rwindow^{2}]} - 1\right),
%     \label{eq:sum_ghost}
% \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
% 
%\noindent and the sum of the ghost of order higher than 1 is defined as:
%
% \begin{equation}
%     G_{n>1}(\lambda) = G_{n>0}(\lambda) - G_1(\lambda).
%     \label{eq:sum_ghost_sup_1}
% \end{equation}
%
%\noindent As we measure the photometry of the 1\up{st} order ghost $G_1(\lambda)$, we want to verify that the ghosts of higher orders $G_{\mathrm{n}>1}(\lambda)$ are negligible. Using the Equations~\ref{eq:ratio_ghost}, \ref{eq:g0} and \ref{eq:gn}, we can compute $\Rccd$:
%
%\begin{equation}
%    \Rccd = \frac{\Kghost}{\Rwindow (2 - \Rwindow)}.
%    \label{eq:rccd}
%\end{equation}

%We measured $G_1(\lambda)$ with photometry, and estimate $G_{\mathrm{n}>1}$ with the equations above. We show the ratio $K_{G_{\mathrm{n}>1}/G_0}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:ratio_ginf_g0}, and we see that $K_{G_{\mathrm{n}>1}/G_0}$ is always below the per mil level. Since $G_{\mathrm{n}>1}$ contribute for less than a per mil of $G_0(\lambda)$, we decide to neglect it.

%\subsubsection{Ghost contribution for \bpinhole pinhole}
%
%The total charges $\Qccd{}_{, \, \SI{5}{\milli\meter}}(\lambda)$ measured by doing the aperture photometry at 300 pixels for the \bpinhole pinhole is the sum of the charges $Q_0(\lambda)$ in the main spot $G_0(\lambda)$ and the charges $\Qghost(\lambda)$ in the 1\up{st} order ghost $G_1(\lambda)$. With $\Eccd$ the quantum efficiency of the StarDICE CCD camera, we define these quantites as:
%
%\begin{equation}
%    \Qghost(\lambda) = G_1(\lambda) \times \Eccd, 
%    \label{eq:qghost}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%    Q_0(\lambda) = G_0(\lambda) \times \Eccd.
%    \label{eq:qmain}
%\end{equation}
%
%\noindent Then $Q_0(\lambda)$ can be measured as follow:
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned}
%    Q_0(\lambda) & = \Qccd{}_{, \, \SI{5}{\milli\meter}}(\lambda) - \Qghost(\lambda) \\
%    & = \frac{\Qccd{}_{, \, \SI{5}{\milli\meter}}(\lambda)}{1 + \Kghost}.
%    \label{eq:qccd_5mm}
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%We use the estimation of $\Kghost$ with the \spinhole pinhole to obtain $Q_0(\lambda)$. 
%
%\noindent Once we have corrected the \bpinhole pinhole from the ghost contribution, we can compute the ratio between the \SD responses defined as $\Kpinholes$: 
%\begin{equation}
%    \Kpinholes = \frac{\Rcbp^{\bpinhole}(\lambda)}{\Rcbp^{\spinhole}(\lambda)}.
%    \label{eq:ratio_pinholes}
%\end{equation}
%Thanks to this equation, we can infer $\Rcbp^{\spinhole}(\lambda)$ from the measurement of $\Rcbp^{\bpinhole}(\lambda)$.
%
%\THIERRY{à finir : comment on corrige le ghost ? est-ce que la correction d'ouverture est suffisante ?}
%
%We show these ratios before and after the ghost correction in the upper Figure~\ref{fig:ratio_pinholes}. We expect the ratio to be linear since it should be the ratio of two surfaces, so we draw a linear spline through the data. In the ultraviolet below \SI{400}{\nm} where the window is highly reflective, we see that the ghost correction has flattened the ratios. Above \SI{900}{\nm} we can see a significative difference between the ratio and the linear spline. This phenomenon is not quite understood and is discussed in section \ref{sec:discussion}, but we precise that the linear fit is made only for the wavelengths below \SI{900}{\nano\meter}.

\subsection{\SD response}

In this section we present the results obtained for the \SD throughput measurement with the \bpinhole pinhole from dataset No.~8; the StarDICE throughput and its filter and grating transmissions measurement with the \spinhole pinhole from dataset No.~6; and the measurements of the datasets No.~2, No.~3 and No.~12. 

\subsubsection{\SD throughput with \bpinhole pinhole}

The Figure~\ref{fig:stardice_5mm_response} show the \SD response obtained with the \bpinhole pinhole, and no filter.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\SD throughput and filter transmissions with \spinhole pinhole}

The Figure~\ref{fig:stardice_75um_response} show the \SD response obtained with the \spinhole pinhole, with all filters. In this figure can see that the wavelength resolution is precise enough to have several points in the filter edges, which is a good feature to measure precisely the filter central wavelength.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\SD grating transmissions}

The Figure~\ref{fig:stardice_grating_response} show the \SD response obtained with the \spinhole pinhole, with the grating set in the filterwheel. The grating being blazed so that the 1\up{st} order of diffraction is the brightest, so this is where the signal is the better as it can be seen in the relative uncertainties panel. We see a cut of the 2\up{nd} and 3\up{rd} order that correspond to the wavelength at which the signal is outside the CCD sensor.

\subsubsection{Radial positions}

The upper Figure~\ref{fig:radial_positions} show the \SD response obtained with the \spinhole pinhole and without filters for the different radial positions on the mirror shown in Figure~\ref{fig:8_mirror_positions} left, and the same focal plane position. The lower figure shows the relative difference to the mean spline going through the four responses. In the ultraviolet below \SI{450}{\nm}, we can see a significant difference between the four radial positions. It goes up to 30\%, and it will be discussed in the section \ref{sec:discussion}. What we see above \SI{1000}{\nm} in the infrared is the result of the data oscillations around the spline caused by the fringing.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Quadrant positions}

The upper Figure~\ref{fig:radial_positions} show the \SD response obtained with the \spinhole pinhole and without filters for the different quadrant positions on the mirror shown in Figure~\ref{fig:8_mirror_positions} right, and the same focal plane position. The lower figure show the normalized residuals to the mean spline going through the four responses. We see again a divergence below \SI{400}{\nm} of about 20\% at most. The phenomenon in the infrared is still caused by the fringing.

\subsubsection{Focal plane positions}

The upper Figure~\ref{fig:ccd_positions} show the \SD response obtained with the \spinhole pinhole and without filters for the same radial and quadrant position on the mirror, and the different focal planes positions from the grid show in Figure~\ref{fig:ccd_grid}. The lower figure show the normalized residuals to the mean spline going through the sixteen responses.
