\section{Measurement of the \SD telescope response}
\label{sec:rsd}
\label{sec:sd_datadesc}

In this section, we present the measurement of the \SD telescope response $\Rtel(\lambda)$ from CBP shoots using the \spinhole pinhole. One difficulty is the intercalibration between the \spinhole pinhole and the \bpinhole pinhole with which the CBP transmission has been determined in the previous section. Both produce images that are contained in the \SD sensor as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ccd_examples}, but the latter form an image of about 250 pixels in radius while the first forms an image of about 4 pixels in radius. Their photometry is thus very differently affected by issues such as ghost reflection and light scattered in the tails of the PSF. To produce an accurate measurement of this ratio we start by building a model of the PSF of the \SD/CBP assembly including the reflection of light in the optics. We use this model to correct the intercalibration ratio measured with run No.~8 data. We then describe the generic photometry method applied to all other runs using the \spinhole pinhole data, and present the resulting response measurements.

The ghost reflection is visible for both images at the left of the main spot. In the \bpinhole pinhole image, a large annulus around the main spot is visible and corresponds to light diffusion around a mechanical iris at the input of the CBP.}

\subsection{Modelisation of the \SD PSF on \spinhole pinhole data}
\label{sec:modelisation-sd-psf}

Figure~\ref{fig:ghost_contrast} shows stacks of images obtained with the \spinhole pinhole in the absence of any filter. The illumination of a section of the primary StarDICE mirror results in a superimposition of the \SD telescope PSF, and a set of additional fainter images that we call ghosts. The ghosts result from undesired but unavoidable reflections on optical surfaces. The most visible ones come from the beam reflection on the CCD surface and back reflection on its covering window, as described in Figure~\ref{fig:schema_ghost}.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig/ghost_contrast.pdf}
    \caption{Stack of images at different wavelengths, with one image per nanometer. \textit{Left:} Stack of images between \SI{350}{\nano\meter} and \SI{450}{\nano\meter}. The scale is set on the ZScale from IRAF to make faint features visible. The spot of interest $G_0$ is at the center, and the ghost reflections are at its left. The circles correspond to the aperture photometry at different radii, when an annulus contains ghost contribution, it is colored with respect to the order of the ghost. The red area around the 1$\up{st}$ order ghost represents the area where the photometry of the ghost is measured. \textit{Right:} Same image but for a stack of images between \SI{1000}{\nano\meter} and \SI{1100}{\nano\meter}. We note that the 2$\up{nd}$ order ghost is not visible for the stack in the UV, where the 1$\up{st}$ order is maximal, while it is visible in the IR, where the 1$\up{st}$ order is lower.}
    \label{fig:ghost_contrast}

\end{figure}

For each image in this dataset, we subtract a bias pattern, estimated on a column and row basis by computing the mean of the horizontal and vertical overscans. We then perform aperture photometry for a radius $r=\SI{20.9}{pixels}$, and then for successive annulus of external radius from \SI{24.9}{pixels} to \SI{419.1}{pixels}. These radii are regularly spaced on a logarithm scale shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ghost_contrast}.

%The overscan estimates are obtained as the mean n of each column $i$ of the horizontal overscan and each row $j$ of the vertical overscan is computed. For each pixel $(i, j)$, we subtract the sum of the estimation of the overscan estimated on the column $i$ and the row $j$. \\
To fit those data, we propose a model of the \SD telescope PSF as the sum of a Moffat function, a constant background level, and contributions from ghosts at specific distances from the main spot. The Moffat function \citep{moffat}, integrated in an aperture of radius $r,$ writes:
\begin{equation}
M(r, \lambda)= 1 - \left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha(\lambda)^2} \right)^{1-\beta(\lambda)},
\end{equation}
with $\alpha(\lambda)$ and $\beta(\lambda)$ the scale and exponent parameters of the Moffat distribution which depend on the wavelength. The flux $F(r, \lambda)$ measured in the CCD with aperture photometry, can then be modelized as: 
\begin{equation}
F(r, \lambda) = A(\lambda) \times \frac{M(r, \lambda) + \Kghostfit(r, \lambda)}{1 + \Kghostfit(r \rightarrow +\infty, \lambda)} + \pi r^2 bkg(\lambda),
\label{eq:moffat_model}
\end{equation}
with $A(\lambda)$ the total amplitude, $\Kghostfit(r, \lambda) = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} G_n(\lambda)}{A(\lambda)}$ the relative contribution of the sum of all the ghosts $G_n(\lambda)$, and $bkg(\lambda)$ the background level in ADU/pixel. 

The evolution of the Moffat distribution is smooth with respect to wavelength. We therefore develop the parameters $\alpha(\lambda)$ and $\beta(\lambda)$  on a B-spline basis with 15 wavelength nodes regularly spaced between \SI{350}{\nano\meter} to \SI{1100}{\nano\meter}. The same goes for the function $\Kghostfit(r, \lambda)$ as it corresponds to light reflections on surfaces in the optical path. This reduces the number of free parameters and allows us to perform outlier rejection of a few annulus whose photometry was affected by a cosmic ray (9 photometric points affected out of 13122 measurements). The results of the fit are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:result_params}.

The most striking result is a significant degradation of the PSF
after \SI{950}{nm}, as witnessed by the steep decrease of the value of
the $\beta$ Moffat parameter and the increase of the $\alpha$
parameter presented in the first and second panels. This effect is also
visible when comparing the two stacks in
Fig.~\ref{fig:ghost_contrast}. We were not able to pin down the exact
origin of this degradation. A potential explanation could be that one
of the reflective surfaces becomes partially transparent at these
wavelengths and generates diffused light. The consequence of this
effect on photometry will be further discussed in Sect.

The $\alpha(\lambda)$ and $\beta(\lambda)$ best-fit parameters are
otherwise fairly stable within \SI{350}{\nano\meter} and
\SI{900}{\nano\meter}. The third panel shows the background level
reconstructed across all wavelengths. With a mean of
$\mu_\mathrm{bkg, fitted}=\SI{0.267}{ADU/pixel}$ for an exposure time
of \SI{1.1}{\second}, it is very consistent with the values measured
on dark images. Two datasets of dark images have been studied, one
with the laser turned off, and a second by masking the CBP output with
a cap (dataset No.~9 in Table~\ref{tab:schedule}). Both datasets show
no trend in time or wavelength and have a mean value of
$\mu_\mathrm{dark, photometry}=\SI{0.252}{ADU/pixel}$ and a standard
deviation $\sigma_\mathrm{dark, photometry}=\SI{0.059}{ADU/pixel}$,
represented by the black dashed line and shaded area in this third
panel.

The fourth panel presents the relative contribution of the first order
ghost $G_1(\lambda)$,
$\Kghostfitfirst(\lambda) = \frac{G_1(\lambda)}{A(\lambda)}$ in
percent. We compared these reconstructed values with direct photometry
of the visible first order ghost pattern performed in 2D images as
detailed in Appendix~\ref{sec:ghost_photometry}. This more direct
determination of the ratio $\Kghost$ is shown as the dashed black
line. The two different methods match perfectly up to \SI{950}{nm}
showing that the identified ghost constitutes the only significant
deviation from the Moffat profile. Beyond \SI{950}{nm} the second method
does not give an accurate photometry for the ghost because it starts
to be mixed with the core of the PSF.

%fraction $\Kghost=\frac{G_1(\lambda)}{G_0(\lambda)}$ obtained by photometry measurements on the first order ghost $G_1(\lambda)$ and the main spot $G_0(\lambda)$. The method to perform ghost photometry. The ratio and $\Kghostfitfirst$ obtained with two different methods on two different datasets are superimposing well below \SI{950}{\nano\meter}, which gives us confidence about the accuracy of this measurement. The deviation above \SI{950}{\nano\meter} between the two methods can be explained by the following arguments. the $\alpha(\lambda)$ and $\beta(\lambda)$ parameters indicate a deterioration of the PSF, which starts to overflow in the ghost photometry. In addition, interference fringes are appearing in the focal plane at these wavelengths, complicating the ghost photometry. As the fit accounts for the PSF evolution, the fitted result gives more confidence in its accuracy.

The reduced chi-squared of the fit is 1.86 explained by the fact that
the Moffat shape does not describe the complex shape of the PSF
core. To mitigate this issue, and as we are mainly interested in
modeling the tails of the PSF, we start our profile modeling at a
rather large inner aperture of 20.9 pixels where residuals no longer
display visible structure and the chi-square displays no trend in
wavelength. Going to a larger inner aperture increases the quality of the
fit but decrease its stability as the scale parameter $\alpha$ is no
longer properly constrained.

\subsection{Accounting for CBP laser light contamination}\label{sec:sd_contaminations}

As for the photodiode and the solar cell (see Sections~\ref{sec:532_cont} and~\ref{sec:fluorescence}), the total signal measured in the \SD camera $\Qccdmes$ is the sum of the flux from the main laser line $\Qccdcal$ and the flux from the \SI{532}{\nm} contamination $\Qccd^{532}$, the $\lambda_{\rm comp}$ contamination $\Qccd^{\lambda_{\rm comp}}$, and the integrating sphere fluorescence $\Qccd^{\mathrm{fluo}}$, as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \Qccdmes = \Qccdcal + \Qccd^{532} + \Qccd^{\lambda_{\rm comp}} + \Qccd^{\mathrm{fluo}}
    \label{eq:qccd_mes}
\end{equation}
The contamination light in the \SD camera can be estimated by multiplying $\Qphot^{532}$, $\Qphot^{\lambda_{\rm comp}}$ and $\Qphot^{\mathrm{fluo}}$ measured with the CBP photodiode by a first estimation of $\Rcbp(\lambda)$ and $\Rtel(\lambda)$. We then refine the measurement of $\Rtel(\lambda)$ and correct iteratively the effect of those contaminations.

The results of this procedure are best illustrated by its impact on the \SD $g$ filter transmission measurement as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:g_filter_532}, the most affected by integrating sphere fluorescence and \SI{532}{\nano\meter} line.

\subsection{Pinhole intercalibration}

Figure~\ref{fig:stardice_5mm_response} shows the \SD response obtained with the \bpinhole pinhole and no filter.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig/stardice_5mm_response.pdf}
    \caption{\textit{Top:} \SD response with no filter and \bpinhole pinhole with respect to wavelength in nanometer. \textit{Bottom:} Uncertainties over the \SD response measurement with respect to wavelength in nanometer.}
    \label{fig:stardice_5mm_response}
    %~/stardice/analysis/cbp_paper/golden_sample_analysis/dr2/response_plots.ipynb
\end{figure}

It is necessary to intercalibrate the \SD response measurements obtained with the \spinhole pinhole with the CBP response measurements obtained with the \bpinhole pinhole. To link these measurements, we measure the \SD responses with the \spinhole pinhole and the \bpinhole pinhole and compute the pinholes ratio $\Kpinholes$. This ratio is defined such as the $\Rcbp$ defined in Equation~\ref{eq:rsd} is the \spinhole pinhole CBP response $\Rcbp^{\spinhole}$, which can be obtained with the \bpinhole pinhole CBP response $\Rcbp^{\bpinhole}$:

\begin{equation}
	\Rcbp(\lambda) \equiv \Rcbp^{\spinhole}(\lambda) = \Rcbp^{\bpinhole}(\lambda) \times \Kpinholes
\end{equation}

When shooting with the \bpinhole pinhole, the main spot is not a pointlike source, hence the data reduction of $\Qccd^{\bpinhole}$ is different than the baseline photometry. The overscan subtraction and the light contamination correction are done with the same method as the \spinhole pinhole, detailed respectively in \ref{sec:overscan} and \ref{sec:sd_contaminations}. However, the background subtraction cannot be performed the same way. 

When using \bpinhole pinhole, the main spot takes a significant area of the focal plane, meaning there is not enough background in the image to reconstruct it. The background is measured with dark exposures with the dark datasets mentioned above, and the spatial mean of all these dark images is computed to obtain a master dark. The background contribution is estimated by aperture photometry in the master dark at the same position and same radius as the laser-on images. $\Qccd^{\bpinhole}$ is measured with aperture photometry, after background subtraction. The optimal radius is evaluated at 300 pixels for the \bpinhole pinhole to contain the main spot and the 1\up{st} order ghost. We could have increased the radius to contain the iris flux, but it would have added as much noise as the signal gained. 

To compare the \SD responses for both pinholes, we need to measure the fluxes with aperture photometry at the same radius so that they contain the same features, such as the ghost contribution. This way there is no other consideration than the geometry of the pinholes. We estimate the \spinhole pinhole flux $F(300, \lambda)$, $\Qccd^{\bpinhole}$ with the method described in Section~\ref{sec:photometry_big}. We compute the ratio $\Kpinholes=\frac{F(300)}{\Qccd^{\bpinhole}}$ and show the result in Figure~\ref{fig:ratio_pinholes}. The linear fit of this ratio is used to intercalibrate the \bpinhole pinhole $\Rcbp(\lambda)$ obtained and the \spinhole pinhole \SD for every measurement of this analysis.

%The non-null slope and not expected as the ratio between the two pinholes should correspond only to the ratio of surfaces of the illuminated area at the input CBP. We suspect that some light diffusion on the edges of the pinholes or other complex reflections in the setup could give this ratio a chromatic dependence.

\subsection{Photometry applicable to on-sky data}
\label{sec:photometry_small}

The measurement of the PSF at a long distance from its core is possible in CBP images because of the very low level of background light in these images. It is impractical to port this method to on-sky data. We choose to carry out the throughput measurement for an aperture photometry and a background estimation algorithm applicable to on-sky data. 

The photometry is performed as follows. To estimate the background contribution, the sources in the image need to be detected and masked. We compute the standard deviation of an image $\sigma$, and every pixel with a signal higher than 5$\sigma$ is masked, as well as all the surrounding pixels that have a signal higher than 2$\sigma$. Then we proceed to a segmentation of the masked image into boxes of $129\times132$ pixels. We compute the mean and the standard deviation of the background in each of these boxes, and we interpolate their values in a 2D map to get our estimation of the background. This background estimation is subtracted from the image. Then, the centroid of the spot of interest is computed to pursue aperture photometry at this position. $\Qccd$ is measured with aperture photometry at a radius of \SI{20.9}{pixels} for every image of the dataset with the \spinhole.

Based on the model built in Sect.~\ref{sec:modelisation-sd-psf}, we can quantify the fraction of the total flux measured in \spinhole pinhole images with this aperture photometry method. We define the fraction of flux missed as the ratio between the value measured with photometry for a given radius and the total amplitude $A$ fitted for a given wavelength. The result is given as the blue curve in Figure~\ref{fig:bias_aperture}. About 98\% of the flux is collected between \SI{400}{\nano\meter} and \SI{900}{\nano\meter}. The ghost contribution, which is missed when using an aperture of \SI{20.9}{pixels}, contributes about another extra percent below \SI{400}{\nano\meter}. Above \SI{900}{\nano\meter} where the PSF is degrading fast, the fraction of flux missed increases by one order of magnitude and reaches more than 75\% at \SI{1050}{nm}.

While most of this effect is directly explained by the aperture correction, a small contribution also comes from a bias in the background estimate, caused by the pollution of the background map by the source PSF tails. Given that the model of the PSF predicts the value of the aperture correction (red curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:bias_aperture}), we can estimate the contribution of the background bias as the difference between the two curves. This curve, shown on the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:bias_aperture}, shows that the background bias contributes about 0.2\% of the total flux.

\begin{figure}[h]
     \centering
     \resizebox{\hsize}{!}{\includegraphics{fig/bias_aperture.pdf}}
     \caption{\textit{Top:} Fraction of missing flux against $\lambda_L$ when measuring \spinhole pinhole dataset with aperture photometry at \SI{20.9}{pixels} rather than taking the total amplitude $A$ fitted.

%
% TODO une conclusion qui dit: Les résultats sont valables pour cette photométrie, si la PSF sur le ciel n'est pas trop différente. Entre 900 et 400 ça devrait faire gros. Mais au-delà va savoir. Les résultats seront révisés quand on aura la PSF sur le ciel
% 
We can conclude that the baseline aperture photometry for the \spinhole pinhole can be used for the range between \SI{400}{\nano\meter} and \SI{900}{\nano\meter}. Below \SI{400}{\nano\meter} there is a need to take care of the ghost contribution. Above \SI{900}{\nano\meter}, this method does not measure a representative flux of the target. It is believed that the \SD telescope is the one responsible for the PSF degradation, one possible explanation is that the primary mirror is becoming partially transparent and generating defocused light. Anyhow, the CBP measurements cannot be trusted in this wavelength range. 


% The bottom panel corresponds to the aperture correction that is needed to apply to the aperture photometry measurement. It is around 2\% below \SI{950}{\nano\meter}, and increases by one order of magnitude in the infrared. This increase is correlated with the variation of the Moffat parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, showing that the PSF is drastically changing in the near-infrared. This issue is discussed in more details section \ref{sec:ir}. The third panel shows a constant background against wavelength, at a mean of \SI{0.27}{ADU/pixel}.

\subsection{Results}
\subsubsection{\SD response and filter transmissions}

We measured the \SD response with the empty slot of the filterwheel, and the transmission of the $ugrizy$ filter, as well as the grating transmission with dataset No.~6, using the \spinhole pinhole, and shooting in a fix mirror and focal plane position. Figure~\ref{fig:stardice_75um_response} shows the results obtained. We note that the wavelength coverage does not scan the full passband of the $u$ filter, which means that this filter will need another measurement to be trustfully used to analyse on-sky data.

Looking at the relative uncertainties, the results show a precision of \textasciitilde\SI{0.5}{\%} for all the filter transmissions, the empty filterwheel slot, and the 1$^\mathrm{st}$ order of the diffraction grating from \SIrange{400}{950}{\nano\meter}. Additionally, we observe that the wavelength resolution is high enough to resolve the filter bandpasses edges.

\subsubsection{\SD Responses variations}

As the CBP is illuminated a portion of the \SD primary mirror, the response measured can be subject to variations according to the mirror position targeted. Dataset No.~2 and No.~3 were acquired to investigate these variations. This paper focuses on dataset No.2, as it is used to synthesize the full pupil transmission in Section\ref{sec:pupil_stitching}. The \SD responses for the four radial mirror positions (see Figure\ref{fig:8_mirror_positions}) are shown in the left panel of Figure\ref{fig:radial_positions}.

The bottom panel displays the relative differences compared to the mean spline through the four responses. Two notable features emerge: one above \SI{900}{\nano\meter}, caused by interference fringing patterns in the sensor, and another below \SI{400}{\nano\meter}, which was unexpected, showing a discrepancy of more than \SI{20}{\%} between the different responses. This feature might be explained by the Hilux coating\footnote{\url{https://www.orionoptics.co.uk/optical-coatings/}} on the \SD mirrors, whose reflectivity varies with the light incidence angle.

Varying the incidence angle also affects the \SD bandpass edges. Due to the interferometric nature of the \SD filters, greater incidence angles cause the bandpass edges to shift toward bluer wavelengths. Figure~\ref{fig:blueshift} shows edges of the $g$, $r$, $z$, and $y$ bandpasses for four different radial positions on the primary mirror. The edges are noticeably bluer at higher radial positions, which correspond to higher incidence angles.

On the other hand, the dataset No.~12 allows for measuring variabilities of the \SD responses for different focal plane positions, with a fix position on the primary mirror. These responses are shown in right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:radial_positions}. In the bottom plot, we notice the same feature above \SI{900}{\nano\meter} caused by interference fringing in the sensor, while the responses are extremely consistent for wavelengths below.
