- First of all, many thanks for all the time and effort and care that has gone into this excellent paper! It's been great to work in partnership on this with you all.

We are also very glad of this fruitful and pleasant collaboration !



1. Rather than Department of Astronomy, a better affiliation for the Harvard people is Department of Physics.
done

2. Can we please add our DOE award to the acknowledgments? CWS, EU, and SB are grateful to the US Department of Energy for support under Cosmic Frontier award DE- SC0007881
done

3. Abstract, context portion line 3: upcoming SN surveys require improved precision, not improved accuracy. (All SN cosmology distance modulus measurements are relative)
done

4. Abstract: ‘aims’ section final sentence- make it filters? (plural)
done

5. Abstract conclusions- spelling typo in characterizing, the h is missing. Also we should be consistent with either the British (with an s) or US spelling (with a z). Title has it one way, its the other way here.
done

6.  Second paragraph of the introduction- last phrase should say precision rather than accuracy. Those words are not interchangeable.
done

7. Regarding this part of the third paragraph of introduction:   
I don't think it's enough to know the effective central wavelength. I contend we need to know  S(lamba), the full photon sensitivity function.
We changed the sentence to be more precise:
(ii) the survey filters transmissions as a function of wavelength, with a particular attention given to the bandpasses edges wavelength position.


8.  Here on page 2:   
Both Hassleblad and Richey-Chretien are not spelled correctly. There are other spelling errors that can be found by running a spell-checking program on the file. Let me know if I can help with that. I'm not going to flag spelling from here onward
done


9. Section 2.2 I think the basic pulsed laser runs at 1.06 um not 532 nm.
done


10. On page 3, here: 
  
In my view the main reason we use the integrating sphere is to scramble any wavelength-dependent phase space (i.e. angular emission) dependence.
We changed the sentence: The integrating sphere dilutes the flux, breaks the laser light coherence, and eliminates  any spatial dependance to achieve a uniform surface brightness.



11.  Section 3.1.1 should alt be -6? Telecope was pointing down
When aiming the solar cell the telescope is approximately horizontal, We do not recall exactly if it was pointing down or up, but looking at the Figure 2-left, we would say that +6° seems correct. In the end the sign of the coordinate doesn't change the end results: the message we intended to convey is that we aligned the CBP+solar cell for collecting the maximal amount of light.    


12. Doesn't Figure 9 imply some light spilled off the edge of the STARDICE primary? There is no flat spot in altitude..
This is the alignment scan on the solar cell. We reworked the caption to make this clearer. We know from the geometry that the beam fit in the solar cell, but a better sampling would definitely be needed to show that convincingly.


13. Equation 9 needs a period
done

14. Bottom on page 12, sinusoidal functions.
done

15. The text right after Figure 20 seems to be missing part of it?
removed

16. Section 3.6.1, let’s stick to nm rather than using Angstroms?
done

17.  Yikes! Sorry about integrating sphere fluorescence.
Thanks for this comment, otherwise we would never have guessed it was a prank you pulled on us 


18. Page 21: should this flux-calibration conclusion go in the abstract?
done
  
19. Page 26: Table 4 looks rather weird with all those 0.0s and a few 0.1s.
We think it is a french vs US notation issue. 0.0 quotes 1 significative number as a way to set the limit, <0.1 sets it otherwise. Both are equivalent to us. We changed to the later but fear that the table looks haven't impvoved much.

One small thing I might change is twice on page 3 you say you measure something at a 'rate of' and then quote a time in seconds. Rates should generally be in Hz, so you should with either convert the value from s to Hz, or change 'rate' to 'integration time' or something like that.

Abstract:
- sentence 1 : "Serves as a mean" seems weird. I will say "Measurements of Type Ia supernovae magnitudes provide...".
done

- aims aiming for sub-percent : forgot whitespace
done


Introduction:
- "Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are standard candles, a class of objects with predictable luminosity that are used as probes to characterize dark energy" : maybe add "in the recent Universe" ou "late Universe"
done

- "ones supplied by the NIST" : defined the NIST acronym here for the first appearance in the text
done

- "and finally port this calibration to on-sky sources": transfer instead of port
done

- "high wavelength resolution": high spectral resolution
We prefer the term wavelength as we are talking about filter transmission.

- StarDICE telescope throughput and "ugrizy": was in italic before, keep the same formatting
done


2.
- " replaced the Hasselblade" : replacing to keep with the previous bullet points
done


2.1
- "A 9-slots 28.5 mm filter-wheel in front of the camera fea- tures 6 interference filters in the ugrizy photometric system, a Star Analyser 200 diffraction grating, and a 0.2 mm pinhole." : verb is lacking, "placed or positioned in front of the camera"
done

- "non-coated fused-silica window": i think we say "uncoated"
After checking both are acceptable, we kept our version.

- "70°C, delivering a median dark-current of 0.15 e− /sec for the 1s exposures" : I'm surprised by this high-level of dark-current with this kind of expensive high-quality CCD sensor and at this temperature. When I look at the manufacturer specifications (given in attached file), I see more reassuring levels of dark current noise (0.0003 e/px/sec @ -80°C up to 0.01700 e/px/sector the deep depletion version). Are you sure about what you give here ? If so, what a lie from ANDOR.
The number given here are all perfectly in line with the camera booklet 0.15e-/s/pixel @-70°C 0.018@-80 down to 0.0007@-98°C. We opted for operation @-70°C at which the dark current can be neglected for our purpose. 


2.2
- "The Collimated Beam Projector (CBP) general setup needs the following:" I will say something like "general(minimal? you mean?) setup requires the following components"
done

- "This laser is composed of three stages to operate". I will say "This laser operates in three stages (from 335 to 669 nm, from 670 to 1064 nm, and above 1064 nm), resulting in three different regimes of power and light contamination in the CBP."
already modified according to Johan B. comment

- "This laser was chosen for the offered wide wavelength range and the high pulse energy, as source power is an important criteria for the CBP calibration with the solar cell." I will say "This laser was chosen for its wide wavelength range and high pulse energy, as source power is a crucial criterion for CBP calibration with the solar cell."
done


2.3.1
- "The uncertainty cited is from the RMS of the current measurements." I will say "The cited uncertainty arises from the RMS of the current measurements."
done

- "5e-4 per degree" write with 10 power as others
done

- "The solar cell was aligned perpendicalular to the CBP output". I will say "The solar cell was aligned perpendicular to the CBP output beam with a precision better than 1° and remained stationary throughout the entire measurement campaign."
done


2.3.2
"Due to the low resistance of the solar cell, we observed a quite strong current even in dark condition". I will say "Due to the low resistance of the solar cell, we observed a relatively high current of approximately 20 nA even in dark conditions."
done

- "After cancelling the dark current drift, the analysis of the ..." : precise that you analyze it in Fourier space or that you compute the power spectrum at the first sentence of the paragraph
done

- "with the highest shunt resistance we had" : at our disposal
done

2.5
- "Table 1 sum up the three quantities". I will say summarize
done


2.6
Naive question maybe. You say "To check the uniformity of the StarDICE focal plane, a measurement of Rtel (λ) at 16 different positions on the focal plane has been performed.". If for any reason, the rotation angle of the camera changed, would it be possible to recover the throughput information without redoing the experiment ?

The conclusion of the focal plane scan is that the camera is fairly uniform, so at first it does not matter. In practice the focal plane uniformity will be remeasured on stars.


3.2
"During a solar cell measurement run, the laser wavelengths
range between 350 nm and 1100 nm included with steps of 1 nm,
but are randomly chosen to avoid that long-range 1/ f mode in
the solar cell dark current correlates neighboured data points of
the CBP response."
Très habile. C'est du dithering, mais spectral ;) 


3.3.1
eq (6) : c'est sigma_{G}/G = 0.7%
je pinaille sûrement mais "compatible" sans donner d'ordre de grandeur reste peu précis. Mettre les valeurs dans la phrase ou bien dans un tableau avec une colonne pour vos valeurs et une colonne pour celle du fabricant ou bien une footnote avec l'url de la spec du fabricant. 

https://yiqi-oss.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/aliyun/900101234/technical_file/file_97805.pdf je trouve la spec pour le readout ici mais pas pour le gain


3.4.1:
dernière phrase : manque une ponctuation ou autre
removed


3.5:
"interpolatino" : tu parli italiano amico mio
Mi sto formando per il mio post-doc

Table 4: the notation for the SC quantum efficiency from the one given in Equation (1)
done


Fig. 10: bottom rows : maybe set y-axis in log to see the level of master dark and bias compared to the flux peak ?
Log scale degrades a lot the readability of the plot. Master dark and bias are indeed very low compared to signal level
