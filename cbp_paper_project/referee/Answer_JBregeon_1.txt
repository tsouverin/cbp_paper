We thank the referee for his thorough review and answer here in detail to his
comments. We did our best to take all of them into account.



- The paper is a bit long, may be more could be put in appendix, e.g. some very
illustrative figures.

Thanks for the remark, we discussed it and prefer to leave the paper that way
and defer this kind of changes for a discussion with the editor once the paper
accepted..


- It may be worth considering having a table in appendix with the list of
  instruments used and their characteristics, in particular their intrinsic
  resolution for measurements. You could also add the solar cell and photodiode
  characteristics.

- Ocean Optics spectrometer calibration

  - the calibration procedure is quite complicated but it's not obvious why this
    level of complication was needed. Precise uncertainties are computed but
    then not used directly in the line fits but rather taken into account
    afterward, and then you state that the fit does not always work and you have
    to add additional errors... may be you could have a sentence to explain why
    you chose to fit or not fit, with or without weight, or why you chose to
    consider uncertainties outside the fit... etc.

  We reshuffled all the sections corresponding to the spectrograph data analysis,
  with clearer logical links between the different analysis. First things first,
  the spectrograph data aims to calibrate in wavelength the laser bursts and for
  this we did not use an error model to measure peak positions. Then, the
  spectrograph is used also to measure laser contamination. As they are flux
  measurements, we estimated and used an error model for this analysis. I hope
  the sequence of sections is clearer now and reflects well these two
  independent goals.

  - this is especially true since as you state in sec 3.6.1, the sigma_lambda
    that you achieved appears mostly overkill... and you do not even show it on
    Fig. 31

    We think that the fact that the wavelength calibration we achieve, 0.1nm is
    what we aimed at demonstrating as discussed in the Introduction.

    In addition this error doesn't belong to fig 31 where we quote flux
    calibration errors.


  

  - I think it would help the reader to better understand the setup and beam out
     of the laser, by referring to Fig.33 much earlier in the text, e.g. in
     Sec. 2.  It also might be of interest to present a simple schema of the
     calibration chain: NIST diode -> solar cell -> CBP -> StarDICE (+ LEDs)

     We added text to mention that the image of the pinholes are discs and
     decided against a schematics, cf next answer.                  
    

- If you can have these easily, schematics or batoid simulations of the
  different configurations corresponding to Figure 2. would also help the reader
  to understand better where the light goes.


We tried to come up with a good illustration but essentially failed. For
exemple, we have the batoid simulations, however it is very difficult to get a
picture that encompasses all the components while giving relevant explanation on
what happens given the wide range of scale involved. Attached
optical_schematic.png is the sketch of a compressed CBP-STARDICE configuration
figuring the optically active surfaces (bafling, mirrors, sensors, filters,
windows). Hardly readable.
   

- Beware that most figures with many colors are not friendly at all for color
  blind people, you may want to revisit the most important ones.

Thanks for catching this. We are taking this into account and will make sure the
figure pass the editorial requirements by the time the paper is accepted.


## Title
- "photometric instrument" -> why not just "astronomical telescope"? 

We have so far 3 telescopes on the StarDICE mount, the guide telescope, the IR
telescope and the main telescope dedicated to photometry and
spectrophotometry. Also, we would like to emphasize that the throughput of the
entire instrument is measured, including the filters and camera in addition to
the optics.


## abstract

    derived from the CBP measurements to absolute values through the NIST
    calibrated photodiode... or something like that.

    We then derive the StarDICE telescope throughput and filter transmissions
    from the CBP measurements, anchoring it to the absolute calibration provided

  done with small variations in the proposition


- I understand that the paper is focused from work in the context of LSST,
  however I would have expected a reference to the recent set of papers by ZTF,
  that already have to deal with thousands of SNe.
  Agreed, we propose a new paragraph
  
- "To benefit from these incoming statistics"

  - to be coherent with the first sentence of the paragraph, you should explicit
    that these incoming statistics come either from combining multiple surveys
    or new large surveys. (if that's what you mean...)

    The rewrites have taken this into account.

## 2. Laboratory setup
- (4) replaced the Hasselblade camera -> replacing
done


### 2.1 StarDICE
- "The StarDICE photometric instrument consists in a Newton telescope"
  - The StarDICE photometric instrument is based on a Newton telescope… 

  We checked that the language was correct, and prefer our version in order to
  stress the multi-component nature of the setup

- "filter-wheel" -> filter wheel
done

- "camera-filterwheel" -> camera filter wheel
done

- "The z-position of camera-filterwheel assembly is adjustable over 9 cm allowing to focus from distances as close as 35 m up to infinity." 
  - I am sorry I do not understand why the filter position impacts the focus
  - distance?
  We think there is a misunderstanding, the filter wheel is attached to the
  camera, and it is the assembly *camera + filter wheel* as a whole that can be
  moved to adjust the focus. 


- "The 11cm diagonal flat is oversized to ensure the fully-illuminated plane extends over the sensor with a comfortable margin in all optical configurations." 
- Again, I do not understand what you're talking about... what is a "11cm
  diagonal flat"?
  Done : flat -> 11cm diagonal flat secondary mirror

- It may be worth having the batoid drawing of the StarDICE telescope to better explain how it's done. 

The arrangement of the StarDICE telescope is a very standard Newtonian telescope
without field corrector. Also, the 1.6m focal of the primary compared to the
compact arrangement of the other surfaces (~5cm for sensor to filters) makes it
very hard to read anything on the batoid drawings. We clarified a bit the
description but did not include the drawings.


- "altazimutal mount" -> altazimuth mount
done


### 2.2 Collimated beam projector
- "one tunable monochromatic light source" 
  - a tunable monochromatic light source
  done
  
- "lies between 1 to 4 ns" -> 1 and 4 ns
done

- "infra-red" -> infrared
done

- "The pulses are shot" -> Pulses are shot
done

- "with a 1000Hz frequency." -> at 1 kHz.
done

- "This laser is composed of three stages to operate (from 335 to 669 nm, from 670 to 1064 nm and above 1064 nm)"
  - remove parenthesis, and it's not clear what you call "stages", are these
  laser configurations or levels of gradings ?
  done, the stages are operational laser configurations
  
- "important criteria for the CBP calibration with the solar cell."
  - it's the first time you mention the solar cell here, you should specify:
    "with the solar cell used as our reference calibration photodiode, see
    section 2.3"
  done

- "The laser output is purified"
  is "purified" the correct technical term?
  We rewrote the paragraph
  
- "pass-red filter" -> red pass filter
done

- "to filter the 532 nm pump" -> to filter out, or to remove
done 

- "pass-infrared filter"- > infrared pass filter
done

- "pass-blue filter" -> blue pass filter
done

- "to remove a contamination not detected in the spectrometer and which we were not able to identify."
  - if it's not detected in the spectro, and you were not able to identify it,
    how do you know it's there?
    
Operating without this filter results in a notable step in the measured
photodiode/Telescope response ratio which disappears when the filter is in place
to clean the laser beam. It is thus natural to assume some kind of contamination
at a wavelength still visible for the photodiode and cut in the camera. It may
be IR contamination from the pump laser, but we couldn’t demonstrate this since
its wavelength is outside the working range of our spectrograph.

- "The light is then injected" -> After the filter, the light is injected
done 


- "with a wide core diameter of 910 µm"
  - what is the laser diameter after the filter? is it focused before the fiber?

The fiber injector features an off-axis parabolic mirror which focuses the laser
beam in the fiber core. We did not performe  measurements of the beam prior to
the injection. The shape was not a clean Gaussian and was elongated, so it
is difficult to give a precise answer to this specific question. To give an
order of magnitude, the largest dimension of the visible spot was about 5-10mm.


- "The integrating sphere dilutes the laser flux"
  - laser dilution seems to be a thing of its own, but not the phenomenon what
  to refer to here
  modified

- "at a rate of 0.02 s" -> of 50 Hz.
done

- "We also plug an OceanOptic" -> Second, an Ocean Optics (...) spectrometer is
plugged
modified

- "spectrograph" -> please choose either spectrometer or spectrograph and be
coherent
done

- "mounted on the last output port." -> port that is connected to the CBP.
done

- "5 mm" -> and 5 mm
done

- "field of view and gives" -> view, and gives
done

- "The pinhole slider is attached to the ocular of a 154/1370 Ritchey-Chrétien Omegon telescope in order to position the pinhole at the focal point of the optics." 
  - I think you should explicitly write here that this is where you apply your
  concept of defining the CBP as a reversed telescope.
  done,
  
- "altazimutal mount" -> altazimuth mount
done


### 2.3 Solar cell description
- "at a rate of 0.002 s" -> 500 Hz or each 2 ms
done

- "relative to a NIST-calibrated photodiode"
  - please precise what the level of the NIST diode absolute calibration is 

It actually depends on the wavelength. You can find the complete curve in fig 6
of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04913 and the contribution for each band in Table
6 of this paper.

- "The unexpected glitch at ~550 nm is masked by a linear interpolation."
  - unexpected is ok, but do you have an a posteriori explanation?
  Text added. It is due to the use of a 550 long pass filter to cut off the second order contamination light. 
  


- "To determine the effect of temperature on QE, the QE of the solar cell was measured as it was heated."
  - The QE of the solar cell was measured within a temperature range from 32° to
  39 °C
  done
  - but was that the room temperature or the diode temperature? how was it
   controlled? have you monitored temperature of other parts of the system?

Newer version of the solar cell include a temperature sensor in the casing. Our
version did not have it so we periodically controlled the external temperature
of the aluminum solar cell casing with a contact temperature sensor. As a result
of this imperfect procedure Table 6 encompass the effect of a 1.6°C systematic
uncertainty on the operating temperature of the solar cell, which is sensible in
y band.


- "Meanwhile, room temperature was monitored and has not varied more than 2 C."
  - but have you monitored directly the solar cell temperature?
  See above


- I am missing a piece of information: what is the size of the light spot when
 calibrating the solar cell against the NIST diode. The solar cell is large, the
 NIST diode is small. Have you checked that the solar cell QE is uniform over
 its surface or at least over the surface that is used with the CBP?

This question is largely covered in sect. 4 of
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04913. To give a quick summary the Gen 3 solar cells
have ~1% QE dips reflecting the regular 1mm structure of the electrode
implants. The structure is washed out when using beam with typical size
significantly larger. Both the calibration beam and the CBP beam cover a
significant fraction (about 50%) of the cell area.

- "We therefore chose the calibrated solar cell with the highest shunt resistance we had (Rshunt = 1.8 kOhm)"
  - what does this mean exactly? you had bought several and tested them? or
   bought a special one?
  modified, we had several of them, selected among hundreds of cells tested by the Harvard team.

- "limited the burst durations to at most 200 pulses (200 ms)."
  - however Table 2. says 298?

We think there is a misunderstanding here, 298 refers to the Q-switch setting, a
quantity allowing a crude modification of the energy of the individual laser
pulses.


### 2.4 Time Synchronization
- "This custom synchronization device"
  - please mention here that it is arduino based, just because I like arduino :)
  done, with great pleasure!


### 2.5 Measurement principle
- "we know the quantum efficiency of the solar cell from Brownsberger et al. (2022)"
  so you do not use your measurement on Figure 3? why?

modified, we indeed use the one from fig. 3


### 2.6 Measurement overview
- "Table2" -> missing white space
done

- I would propose to rename the first column of Table 2 from "N°" to
"Configuration" or "Setup Configuration", and use "Configuration" in the text
instead of "Line No. n"

We prefer the original version, since it refers to different runs which can share
similar configuration

- "When shooting into the solar cell, the 5 mm pinhole is necessary to achieve good signal-to-noise ratio."
  - what spot size does this give on the solar cell?

he pinhole being at the focal point of the CBP, the footprint in the solar cell
corresponds very closely to the shape of the exit pupil of CBP.  The full 154mm
diameter pupil is stop down to a quarter by a pie-shape mask so that it fits
inside the solar cell. The alignment scans presented in Fig 9. show that,
vertically it fills almost all the solar cell, horizontally it fills
approximately half of the cell.

- "The positions are shown in Figure 8."
  - Figure 8 does not hold much information, it should be enough to write in the
    text that you sample the focal plane with a uniform grid of 16 positions. Or
    may be you could merge Figure 8 with Figure 7... or even actually move
    Figure 7 and 8 to the appendix.

Removed Fig.8  From experience of presenting these results, the mirror
positions were not always clear to everybody. We  would thus rather keep Fig. 7 here


## 3. CBP response calibration with a solar cell


### 3.1 Optics setup
- "we had to use a theoretical value for its focal plane position"
  - not easy to understand... you should explain earlier that you put the CBP at the telescope theoretical focal plane 

The CBP and the telescope are conjugated so that an error in the focal plane
position of one is compensated by an error in the focal plane position of the
other. As the StarDICE telescope focus could not be adjusted on stars it was
focused 2mm behind its actual focal plane. This results in the Collimated Beam
to diverge by 2 mrad. This was thought to be perfectly inconsequential until we
realized that it also affected the ghosting pattern, so that it could no longer
be used to reliably determine the relative positioning of the two instruments.


- "We then locked the diaphragm at the position immediately preceding the flux drop."
  - not very precise without explaining how many positions you scanned  

This adjustment does not require precision. Closing further the iris would
simply decrease the CBP transmission without further cleaning the collimated
beam so it is not suitable. The important aspect is that this adjustment is done
and fixed so that the transmission remains stable afterward.


- Figure 9
  - what is the size of the CBP spot on the solar cell again? ♐ See answer above
  - why does the solar cell response appear to show slightly different dependence in Alt and Az (flatter)?

This is because the extent of the collimated beam is larger in the vertical
direction. When scanning in the horizontal direction, the beam stays contained
entirely within the solar cell for a wider range of angles while the flux drops
almost immediately in the vertical direction as a part of the beam misses the
cell footprint.

  - does this graph show that the solar cell response is far from being uniform?

No, this scan was performed for alignment purpose only. It does not have the
sensitivity to test for uniformity of the solar cell response which is at the
%level.




### 3.2 Description of the CBP data set
- "(see examples in Figure 10)"
  - you should specify on Figure 10 to which setup configuration the data
  pertain
  done

- "photodiode (...) which is the common instrument between the CBP and StarDICE"
  - do you really mean "photodiode" and not solar cell?  
    the solar cell is the real "common instrument between CBP and StarDICE",
    while the photodiode is the link to get the absolute flux
    rephrased

- although there are some numbers on Figure 10, you could explicitly mention the
  target charge in both the solar cell and photodiode so that you consider these
  work in their linear regime
  
  The linearity of the measurement is tested by varying the laser intensity and presented in Sect. 3.6.5


- "In particular, five runs were recorded just before the StarDICE telescope measurement, and five new runs were launched just after." 
  - please refer to Table 2 configurations 4, 5 and 6.
  done

- "Runs with different settings have been conducted to esti-mate systematic uncertainties"
  - are these in Table 2. or preliminary or a posteriori tests?
  modified, it is in Table 2


### 3.3 Spectrograph data reduction
- Equation (5) is not aligned with 4 and 6 done

- "we subtract the master bias B(λ p ) and compute a master dark spectrum D(λ p ), taking the median of all the dark spectra."

  - I do not understand if you build a new master dark from "laser off" data or
    if you use data from section 3.3.1 ...  indeed you should refer to equation
    (7) that clarifies this point.
    done


- "As the signal-to-noise in the stacked spectrum is very high, we assimilate the S (λ p ) value to its empirical average to get σi,p ."
  - I am not sure I understand what this means... what is the statistical meaning of "empirical average"?

When the signal is low, flux noise is Poissonian and provides more positive
fluctuations than negative fluctuations then strictly speaking we can not say
that the acquired signal is close to its mean if we would have done many noise
realisations. With high signals, flux noise is Gaussian and positive or negative
fluctuations are equal. Then it’s more legal to identify the signal with its
empirical mean.

- "The lambda g fit is unweighted as for the spectrograph calibration process."
  - that's quite cryptic at this point, and you give no explanation here... you
    carefully compute uncertainties but decide not to use these? 

Yes indeed. We hope the new version is clearer. Arc lamp signal is huge, and we
are more dominated by PSF modelling than noise, plus we saw that the wavelength
was biased at high signal is fit is weighted. In the new version, the error
model is explained at the end just for the purpose of laser contamination flux
measurements.

- "Q flux are computed summing pixels"
  - I find it not very coherent to first run a Gaussian fit while you have only
   a few points in your line (weighted average could be enough), and then
   instead of computing the integral of your fitted Gaussian, you go back to
   summing signals from pixels, hence being subjected to quantization effect
   again. 

The Gaussian profile is not a correct description of the line profile. It is used
to detect the line position and its width, so as to we get the window where to
sum the pixels

- "The fit is unweighted to avoid any dependence of λg with the line flux and checked it was the case, but a statistical uncertainty σnoise is still estimated for lambdag"
  - again, I do not understand the story behind this "unweighted fit" and the link with a possible dependence on the line flux.
  - the sentence is not grammatically correct
  done

We acquired different spectra with different exposure times and we observed a
shift of the centroid wavelength with signal to noise ratio if fit is
weighted. If the fit was unweighted, the shift disappeared.


 
- "the covariance matrix is then re-scaled with a global factor to get a final reduced χ2λ of one that we call C_lambda ."
  - not well written, it sounds like "C_lambda" is the global scaling factor,
    while it's actually the covariance matrix: please rephrase
  done
  

- "During the data acquisition campaign, we did not unplug and plug again the optical fibre (...) did not change the wavelength scale.
  useless paragraph, remove
  done
  
- "Thanks to this procedure, we were able to apply the fitted third order polynomial correction to all detected wavelength lambda_g to get calibrated wavelengths lambda_c ." 
  - rephrase as something like "We applied the third order polynomial to
    calibrate Lambda_g into Lambda_c".
  done


- "the Gaussian profile is an incomplete model of high signal-to-noise lines."
  - hence, I understand even less why you decide to fit a Gaussian in the first place

The emission lines have assymetric pedestals so the average of the data points
is biased. The symmetric Gaussian profile is better to find the peak position

- "PSF modelling" -> PSF!?
- we have values for Sigma_PSF and Sigma_cal, but no indication of the value of sigma_noise... would be nice to have a scale

It is sigma_cal - ~0.012nm (in quadrature) so with Figure 22 we can read that it
depends a lot on the wavelength range. It can be comparable to sigma_PSF or
less.

- "The realised laser wavelength is never the one a priori asked for"
  - cannot this be calibrated and calibration constants inserted into the monochromator firmware?

It might be possible, but instead we estimated the bijection between asked
wavelengths and realized wavelengths and used it only for the analysis (Figure
15) 

- "we use the set laser wavelength λL for clarity."
  - well, I am not sure why it's more 'clear' to use a non calibrated wavelength
   when you have the calibrated one available easily... may be just remove "for
   clarity" or change as "for convenience"
  Convenience is a better word, it reflects more its practicality for us 


### 3.4 Electrometer data reduction
- Equation (18) is not aligned with (17)
done

- Figure 18 in appendix?
We decided against breaking the analysis description by deferring part of it to an appendix.

- "The purpose of the term in brackets is to subtract an estimation of the dark
  current contribution during the 2 burst itself." 
  - this could be mention already in sec 3.4.1
  done


### 3.5 CBP ratio charges
- "A first CBP response estimations (...) rCBP"
  - "A first part of the CBP response estimation"

Reformulated as: The ratio of charges $r_{\rm CBP}^{\rm mes} =
\Qsolarmes/\Qphotmes$ is computed to check the statistical uncertainties and
then analyse systematic uncertainties. 


- "If wecompute a mean CBP response"
  - this sentence is not finished?
  removed 


### 3.6 Systematics
- "the CBP response varies slowly in λ and the whole σλ is sub-Angstrom (see Figure 21)."
  - the CBP response varies slowly in λ (Fig. 21) and the whole σλ is
  sub-Angstrom (Fig. 22).
  done 

- Figure 23.: it would nice to have a comment on the fact that the dispersion on
- Qdark_sol/Qdark_phot is much higher for lambda<670 nm

done : "The high dispersion below 670nm corresponds to the wavelength regime
where the laser power is low, inducing a faint ambient light poorly measured."

- "We rejected data where  < 0.1 nm"
  -  > 0.1 nm ?
  done

- Fig. 25: Q532_spectro looks more like a 2nd order polynom... although it
likely does not matter.

Hard to tell, but choosing a 1st order model is safer to extrapolate below 560nm. 

- Figure ylabel corrected
done

- Fig. 29.: I do not understand the meaning of the linear fit.

Because we have only two different distances, we lack measurement to trust the
precise behavior of this curve, so we used the linear fit to estimate at the 1st
order the scattered light systematics, which is then used to estimate a
systematic uncertainty due to this chromatic effect

We propose this precision in the text: There is a decrease of the total light of
about 3\textperthousand\ with a chromatic effect of about 2.5\textperthousand\
difference between \SI{350}{\nano\meter} and \SI{1100}{\nano\meter}, quantified
by the linear fit in Figure~\ref{fig:sc_distance}.

- Fig. 37:  has an extra "[" on the y axis label
done


### 4.3 Pinhole intercalibration
- "400-900nm" -> missing white spaces
done

- Fig. 39: it would be nice to see the residuals, as shown on many other plots
done

### 4.4 Photometry applicable to on-sky data
- "boxes of 129×132 pixels."
  - please relate to a size on the sky
  done

- "the sources in the image need to be detected and masked"
  - may be specify which standard tool you use for that
  
  The reduction code is purposely made and does not use external libraries,
  hence the extensive description of what is made.

- "with the 75 µm." -> pinhole
- Figure 40.: the caption mentions 3 curves, I see only 2
Removed


### 4.5. Results
- Figure 41: I probably misunderstand the graph, but I cannot see the curves for
the diffraction gratings mentioned in the caption.

No it was on our side: the curves were missing ! 



## 5. Synthesis of the equivalent transmission for full pupil illumination


### 5.1. Radial model of the instrument transmission
- do you have a reference for Equation 42?

It can be demonstrated with basic wave optics
(https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/687464/how-to-derive-this-angular-shift-formula-lambda-theta-lambda-0-left1-frac),
but there is not one reference for this formula

- Fig.44 you should precise how the residuals are define here, in sigma or in
fraction (seems so...) or just in "transmission"
done in the caption

- "a dust particle on the filter surface"
  - add a reference to Fig. 45 that is otherwise never referred to in the text,
    this Figure could also just be proposed in appendix.
  done but kept in the text

- "The standard deviation of model/measurement discrepancies is 10.2 mmag"
  it's a bit strange to switch to mmag all of a suden for lab measurements, it
  would make more sense to have Fig.46 in fraction, and if you really wish,
  then mention in the text that this is equivalent to 10 mmag.

Those quantities are akin to the zero points of the instrument passbands which
are usually reported in magnitudes.  

- "Fig. 46 displays the difference between the measured central wavelength and the model-predicted value for all 4 radius positions."
-  "neglects wavelength shift considerations"
  - add "due to the light incidence angle on the filters"
  done


### 5.2. Full pupil synthetic transmission curves
- "A rectangular quadrature"
  - why averaging on a disk using a rectangular sampling?

There is a misunderstanding here, the rectangular quadrature is the method used
to integrate the transmission f(r) as a function of the radius r, which refers
to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum. None of the native speakers
among the review panel appeared to be bothered by the formulation, still we weren't
quite sure what the correct naming was, we switched to "rectangle rule".


- Fig. 47 : any comment on the wiggles observed on the low-end side of the i
  filter?

Not quite sure what you have in mind here. Oscillations in the passbands of interference filters are common.

### 5.3. Final uncertainty budget
- Table 3. "wl cal" -> wavelength calibration
done

- "The telescope is then used to follow CALSPEC standard stars and
precisely measure their broadband fluxes."

- my (wrong?) understanding is that StarDICE follows CALSPEC standards to
validate the calibration with artificial stars (LEDs), if so this should be
explained properly.

It is indeed wrong, we propose: The telescope is then used to observe CALSPEC standard stars and precisely measure their broadband
fluxes, anchoring them to the LEDs absolute calibration.


- "In contrast, the sensitivity to wavelength calibration generally increases..."
  - I propose to remove this paragraph that is a point of detail of possible issues that can be tackled with StarDICE, but is not important to mention here.

This paragraph is necessary to interpret Table 4 which supports the main
conclusion of the paper. Namely that the measurement performs matches the
requirements of the StarDICE experiment in band griz and is not helpful in the
remaining two bands.


## Conclusion
- "by illuminating a calibrated pho-diode" 
  - I think it's worth mentioning that it's a solar cell, it's probably the
  first time that a "dumb" solar cell is used for a very precise flux
  calibration?

  done. The solar cell is by many standards a way more sophisticated device than
  the hamamatsu photodiodes. The amount of engineering that went into bumping
  its quantum efficiency just shy of 98% (to be compared to the mere 60% of Si
  photodiodes) is remarquable.

- "the response of the photometric instrument"
  - of the StarDICE telescope
  done

- "response of the instrument to illumination"
  - instrument -> telescope
  done

- "Most notably, (1), (2), (3)"
  - this way of writing does not quite work, since you have extensive details to
  give for each point. May be just use bullet points? or write 3 clean short
  paragraphs.
  Bullet points are not allowed by the journal and we consider the enumeration important.

- "As a result we expect"
  - As a results, we were able to show through simulations that
  done

- "Providing the necessary amount of calibration time, similar num-
bers are to be expected for the determination of LSST passbands"
  - May be that part could be better explained, to say, that a specific CBP has
  been designed for the Rubin telescope, that scaling from a 16" to an 8 m
  telescope is challenging, etc

done

## Ghost photometry
- It would be nice to give values for Rccd and Rwin, so that the reader can
immediately be convinced that only the first order ghost matters.
We added plot of these quantities
