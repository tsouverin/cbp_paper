\section{Laboratory setup}

\subsection{StarDice}
\label{sec:stardice}

\todo{Marc} The StarDICE photometric instrument (SPI) consists in a
Newton telescope with a primary mirror of $40$cm diameter (16'') and
$1.6$m focal length ($f/D = 4$). The focal plane hosts an Andor Ikon-M
954 camera, equipped with a thermoelectrically cooled, deep depleted
and back illuminated CCD sensor (E2V DU934P). The active area of the
sensors is $13.3\times13.3 mm$ divided in $1024\times 1024$ square
pixel of $13\mu m$ side. In this baseline setup, the pixel resolution
is $1.68$ arcsec and the field of view $28.6\times28.6$ arcmin.

The 11cm diagonal is oversized to ensure the fully-illuminated plane
extends over the sensor with a confortable margin in all optical
configurations.

\begin{itemize}
\item Filter-CCD distance: max 40.80 mm, min 26.80 mm
\item field of view $30'x30'$
\item Custom built mount
\item filters $ugrizy$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collimated Beam Projector}
\label{sec:cbp}

\todo{Jérémy}

The Collimated Beam Projector (CBP) general setup needs the following : one tunable monochromatic lightsource, and an optic device able to recreate a parallel beam from a point source, and mimic a artificial monochromatic light. In our case, the light source is an Ekspla NT252 tunable laser, using a pump laser at \SI{532}{\nano\meter} and non-linear crystals to produce powerful monochromatic pulses from 335 to \SI{2600}{\nano\meter}. The pulse duration is fixed and lies between 1 to \SI{4}{\nano\second} with an energy of \SI{1.1}{\milli\joule} in the near infra-red. The pulses are shot with a fixed frequency of \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz} and can be shot in two modes. The first one is said "continuous", so it shoots pulses in a continuous way. The second one send packet of photons by "bursts". Each burst is composed from 1 to 1000 pulses, meaning the duration of a burst is restrained between \SI{1}{\milli\second} to \SI{1}{\second}. The pulses have a maximum linewidth below \SI{10}{\per\cm}, which can be converted into a maximum spectroscopic width below \SI{0.4}{\nano\meter} around \SI{600}{\nano\meter}. This is an upper limit quoted by the manufacturer, but measurements taken using a similar laser show bandwidths going from \SI{0.08}{\nm} to \SI{0.48}{\nm} in the 350 to \SI{1100}{\nm} range \citep{woodward2018}. The standard deviation of pulse energy is around 2.5\%. This laser is composed of three stages to operate (from 335 to \SI{669}{\nano\meter}, from 670 to \SI{1064}{\nano\meter} and above \SI{1064}{\nano\meter}), which results in three different regimes of power and light contamination in the CBP. This laser was chosen for the offered wide wavelength range and the high pulse energy, which is important for the CBP calibration with the solar cell. 

The laser output is purified with a diaphragm and a filter wheel containing three different broad bandpass filters helps purifying the laser light from pump photons or other resonances in the system. In particular, we use a pass-blue filter BrightLine Multiphoton FF01-680/SP-25 in the regime 530 to \SI{645}{\nano\meter} to remove \todo{a bien justifier}, a pass-red filter RazorEdge LP03-532RU-25 to filter the \SI{532}{\nano\meter} pump photons in the regime 645 to \SI{1074}{\nano\meter}, and a pass-infrared filter RazorEdge LP02-1064RU-25 above \SI{1074}{\nano\meter} to filter \SI{1064}{\nano\meter} photons appearing in this regime. All this optical stage is packed inside a black metallic box to prevent room light contamination.

The light is then injected into an optical fiber \todo{reference fibre} of a diameter of \com{??}\SI{}{\micro\meter}, which is plugged into an IS200-4 $\Phi$2'' integrating sphere from Thorlabs, with a \SI{50}{\mm} diameter and composed of 1 input and 4 outputs. The integrating sphere dilutes the laser flux and breaks the light coherence. Two monitoring instruments are plugged into the=is sphere. First we have a silicon photodiode Thorlabs SM05PD3A with a high efficiency in the UV is mounted on an output port orthogonal to the laser input port to control the laser power stability. It is mounted behind a pinhole to reduce the photon flux and ensure that it works in its linear regime. It is read by a 6514 Keithley electrometer at a rate of \SI{0.02}{\second}. We plug an OceanOptics Q65000 fiber spectrometer on another output to monitor the true laser wavelength and the spectral purity. One output is left free to plug a calibration lamp to calibrate the spectrograph when needed. Finally, a slider with pinholes of different diameters is mounted on the last output port. he figure \ref{fig:sphere} shows a schematic of the integrating sphere and the instruments plugged into it.

In this paper we used three different pinholes, of diameter \SI{5}{\mm}, \SI{2}{\mm} and \SI{75}{\um}. The \SI{5}{\mm} pinhole is the largest possible given the \SD field of view and gives the maximum flux. The other pinholes are used for systematic checks and filter edge analysis. The pinholes are located at the focus of a 154/1370 Ritchey-Chrétien Omegon telescope, mounted on a robotic Celestron NexStar Evolution 6. We want the output beam to fit inside a solar cell, and inside a quarter of the \SD telescope. The output beam being too large, three quarter of the output of the laser is masked. For that we use a black disk cropped with a frame whose shape is a quarter of a disk, corresponding to a quadrant of the secondary mirror spider. A few centimeters after the pinhole, an iris can be closed to stop the light that do not fit in the secondary mirror of the telescope and scatter onto the tube \todo{Marc : verifier la veracite de cette phrase}.

\noindent Here, the slider contains 3 pinholes of different size : \SI{75}{\micro\meter}, \SI{2}{\milli\meter} (respectively P75HK and P2000HK from Thorlabs) \SI{5}{\milli\meter} (homemade). The last slot is left empty. The slider is also attached to the ocular of a Ritchey-Chrétien Omegon Pro RC 154/1370 telescope, in order to position the pinhole at the focal point of the optics. The telescope is mounted on a Celestron Nexstar Evolution mount.  \\

To calibrate the CBP response, a large solar cell is placed at \SI{16}{\cm} \todo{a verifier} approximately from the telescope aperture. It was chosen to have high quantum efficiency and a large shunt resistance. The solar cell absolute quantum efficiency has been measured in Harvard labs~\cite{solarcell}. The solar cell charges are measured by a Keysight B2987A electrometer,

The CBP being set up, it has to aim to the instrument we want to shoot into. Hence we have a C60 solar cell of 3$^{\mathrm{rd}}$ generation from Sunpower. It was chosen to have high quantum efficiency and a large shunt resistance. Its absolute quantum efficiency has been measured in Harvard labs~\cite{solarcell}. This solar cell is set on a two axis mount, one that allows a movement in the direction of the optical axis of the CBP telescope, and another axis that is vertical, which allows to adjust the height of the solar cell. It is placed at \SI{16}{\cm} approximately from the telescope aperture. This solar cell is connected via a coaxial cable to a Keysight B2987A electrometer, the same that has been used for the quantum efficiency measurement. \com{It is able to chop light at a higher frequency than what the Keithley can do, and is a more contemporary instrument (à retirer ?)}. The charges are measured at a rate of \SI{0.002}{\second}. A picture of this setup is shown figure \ref{fig:cbp_setup_sc}. In figure \ref{fig:cbp_setup_sd}, we show a picture of the setup when the CBP is aiming at the StarDice telescope described in section \ref{sec:stardice}.

\subsection{Equations}

\todo{Thierry}

%From equations, draw the data taking plan
%with calibrated wavelength

With the set up described in the section \ref{sec:cbp}, the goal is to obtain the response of the StarDice telescope and its filters transmission. To do so, we will first need to measure the reponse of the CBP optics by shooting into the calibrated solar cell, like shown in figure \ref{fig:cbp_setup_sc}. Once this is done, we can shoot the light coming out of the CBP inside the StarDice telescope to get its reponse, knowing the CBP response. We will need the following quantities : 

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\QPD$: the charges collected in the monitoring photodiode in the integrating sphere, measured by the Keithley 6514 in Coulomb.
    \item $\QSC$: the charges collected in the solar cell and measured by the Keysight 2987A in Coulomb.
    \item $\QSD$: the charges collected by the Andor camera of the StarDice telescope in ADU \com{???}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Thanks to the quantities $\QPD$ and $\QSC$, and knowing the quantum efficiency of the solar cell $\epsilon_{\mathrm{SC}}$ from \cite{solarcell}, as well as the elemental charge of the electron $e$, we can infer obtain the response of the CBP optics $\RCBP$ thanks to the formula \ref{eq:rcbp}.  Hence, it is possible to infer the equation for $\RSD$ knowing $\RCBP$, according to the equation \ref{eq:rsd}. 

\begin{equation}
    \RCBP = \frac{\QSC}{\QPD \times \epsilon_{\mathrm{SC}} \times e}
    \label{eq:rcbp}
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
    \RSD = \frac{\QSD}{\QPD \times \RCBP}
    \label{eq:rsd}
\end{equation}


\noindent These two equations will be the most important ones in the following, and we will focus on $\RCBP$ and $\RSD$ respectively on the sections \ref{sec:rcbp} and \ref{sec:rsd}.

\subsection{Strategy}

The goal can be decompose in 4 
Final measurement shcedule :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Measure CBP response for [350-1100] nm range : Shoot in Solar Cell with a 5mm pinhole
    \item Measure StarDice response for [350-1100] nm range : Shoot at a given position in StarDice for every filter with 75µm, 2mm and 5mm pinhole
    \item Measure the uniformity of the StarDice mirror (“pupil stitching”) : Shoot in StarDice at 8 different positions on the mirror with 5mm pinhole
    \item Measure the uniformity of the StarDice focal plane : Shoot in StarDice telescope at 16 different positions on the focal plane (CCD)
\end{itemize}

Detailed schedule for final measurement :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spectrograph calibration
    \item 8 positions on the mirror; 75µm
    \item 4 positions on different quadrants, no filter, but same radius 
    \item 4 positions at different radius but same quadrant, every filters
    \item 3 repeatability measurements : same position ; every filter ; 75µm
    \item 5 SolarCell runs : QSW = 298, MAX ; 5mm
    \item 5 StarDice runs : EMPTY filter ; 5mm
    \item 5 SolarCell runs : QSW = 298, MAX ; 5mm
    \item 1 StarDice run : pinholes 75µm, 2mm, 5mm
    \item 2 SolarCell runs + 1 StarDice run : cap on the CBP to see ambient light
    \item 2 SolarCell runs : long and short distance (~16cm difference) ; 5mm
    \item (4x4) positions on the CCD ; no filter ; 75µm
    \item Spectrograph calibration
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preparatory settings}

Before illuminating the solar cell with the CBP, several action has to be taken to maximise the quality of the data sets:
\begin{itemize}
\item place the pinholes at the focus of the CBP telescope
\item tune the telescope iris
\item align the CBP and the solar cell, in position and angle
\item mask every ambient light
\item spectrograph calibration
\item \todo{think a lot about what we forgot}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Focussing}

\todo{Marc}


The CBP was aligned with the StarDICE telescope to improve the focus. The
StarDICE camera was set close to infinity with no filter (focus encoder:
8mm). The smallest pinhole (75microns). Adjustment of the CBP focus was
performed by Elana in order to get the smallest extension of the pinhole
image. A slight offset was then added to account for the small change in focus
introduce by tightening the locking screws. Here is a confirming image taken
just after.

The focus was check to resist slot changes and even complete removing and
reinstallation of the pinhole.

For the record mount coordinates to get CBP and telescope aligned were

\subsubsection{Alignment of the CBP}

\todo{Thierry}


\subsubsection{Ambient light}

Ambient light can contaminate randomly the sensitive devices depending on their direction in the lab room. We masked all diodes from computers or electronic devices.

\subsubsection{Spectrograph calibration}

\todo{Marc : I would do a test with your software as you fit the 3rd order polynom in one step}

Before and after the main data acquisition run to measure the CBP and \SD responses, we calibrated the spectrograph according to the manufacturer specifications. Light from a Hg-Ar lamp was injected into the integrating sphere to illuminate the spectrograph sensor. The software \texttt{Spectractor} was used to fit the emission lines. The bijection between the fitted centroids and the tabulated line values were fitted by a third order polynomial function as requested by the manufacturer. Only lines with high significance were used XXXXX. In Figure~\ref{fig:} we plot the residuals of the fit, showing a RMS of approximately XXXX resulting in a wavelength calibration uncertainty of .



\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{spectrograph_calibration}
\caption{Spectrograph calibration plot.}
\end{figure}


During the run, we did not unplug and plug again the optical fibre going from the integrating sphere to the spectrograph. Such an action on the spectrograph side could have changed the wavelength calibration in principle. But beforehand we checked the fibre placement in the spectrograph was very reproducible and do not change the wavelength scale.
 

\subsection{Data set description}


\begin{figure*}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sc_dataset_469}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sc_dataset_966}
\caption{From top to bottom: typical data sets for digital analyzer (pin state 4 is the Keithley output, pin state 2 the laser trigger output, pin state 1 the Keysight start and end time acquisition time stamps), charges in the photodiode, charges in the solar cell, flux in the spectrograph. Left: typical data set at \SI{469}{\nm}. Right: typical data set at \SI{966}{\nm}.}\label{fig:sc_dataset_examples}
\end{figure*}

The laser emits pulses at a fixed rate of \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz}, with a power that highly depends on the wavelength. To ensure that all instruments work in their linear regime, without saturations, and control the dark current, we decided to shoot light in the solar cell in burst of pulses, separated with dark times at least as long as half the burst length. The number of pulses was set to maintain a rather constant total cumulated charge in the photodiode, which is the common instrument between the CBP and \SD response measurements and the one receiving the maximum power in the system. Therefore we expect to minimize eventual non-linear effects in the instrumental chain. The linearity of the CBP system is checked varying the global laser power in section~\ref{XXX}. However, we know we have a $1/f$ noise in the solar cell instrumental chain. To limit the amplitude of these random fluctuations during the burst, we set the maximum number of pulses to 200, and in that case compensated with higher number of bursts.

A typical dataset to measure the CBP response it the emission of laser bursts in the solar cell, at a given wavelength. Charges in the photodiode and solar cell are recorded jointly, as well as the flux in the spectrograph and the time stamps in the digital analyzer (see examples in Figure~\ref{fig:sc_dataset_examples}).

The charges in the photodiode and the solar cell are read with electrometers in charge mode. This mode is better than the current mode as the integration is performed in a capacitance. This avoids to model the precise current time lines before integrating them numerically, as they are subtlety different from squarewave functions due to different time responses in the system and contaminated by random dark current fluctuations. 

We used the \SI{5}{\mm} pinhole with the largest laser power mode to get the highest signal to noise ratio in the solar cell, but also in the \SD telescope. The solar cell accumulates around \SI{4}{\nano\coulomb} in a burst, with no change of Keysight range, knowing that the dark current fluctuations reaches \SI{6546546}{\nano\coulomb} during a burst duration \todo{a verifier}. The Keysight accuracy in this regime is XXXXXX \todo{to check}. 


During a solar cell measurement run, the laser wavelengths are chosen every nanometre between \SI{350}{\nano\meter} and \SI{1100}{\nano\meter}, but they are randomly shuffled before shooting the laser to avoid that long range $1/f$ modes in the solar cell dark current correlates neighboured data points of the CBP response. Several runs were accumulated to enhance the signal to noise ratio. In particular, five runs were recorded jsut before the \SD telescope measurement, and five new runs were launched just after.


To estimate systematic uncertainties, runs with different settings has been conducted. We varied the laser global power to assess the linearity of the instrumental light and check the ambient light additive contamination. We varied the solar cell distance to estimate the output CBP scattered light.

We us a $3/4$ pie-slice mask at the end of the CBP telescope in order to reduce
the beam size, which would otherwile overfill the Solar Cell surface.

Checks to demonstrate that this doesn't impact, via inner reflexions, the
calibration of the CBP telescope.

The CBP was aligned with the StarDICE telescope to improve the focus. The

\subsection{Data reduction}

\todo{check that time stamps are explicitly describe in all items}

In a data set, we accumulated several laser bursts. However, a per burst analysis is conducted to be able to remove outliers more easily. All bursts are combined only at the end of the analysis to get the CBP response.

\subsubsection{Photodiode data reduction overview}

We estimated the total charge accumulated in the charge sequence and the leakage currents at beginning and end of the sequence. For the photodiode, the time stamps come directly from the digital analyser clock, with a sampling at XXXXXXXXX \todo{a verifier}. The burst time breaks also. %To estimate the uncertainties on the raw data points are estimated as the RMS around

For each burst, we fit lines during the dark times before and after the burst, removing the closest points to the burst. A $\chi^2$ minimisation is performed using the \texttt{curve\_fit} method from python library \texttt{scipy}. The uncertainties on the data points are adjusted so that the final reduced $\chi^2$ is one. Doing so we assume that the fit residuals are only due to Gaussian instrumental noise, as justified by the Figure~\ref{fig:}. Note that we do not fit anything during the burst time, as the laser power stability do not guaranty that this can be model with a simple mathematical function. We only use the dark times, that we believe they are modelled with straight lines.

We call $t_1$ and $t_2$ the time stamps of the beginning and ending of the laser burst respectively, given by the laser trigger output itself\footnote{Technically, the laser time stamps give the beginning of the pulse, so we add \SI{1}{\ms} to the last trigger time stamps from the laser to account for the pulse duration \todo{mais c'est faux ça ???}}. The accumulated charge $\Delta q_{\rm mes}$ during a burst is then
        $$\Delta q_{\rm mes} = n_2(t_2) - n_1(t_1) - \frac{1}{2} \left[n_1(t_2) - n_1(t_1) + n_2(t_2) - n_2(t_1)  \right]$$
where $n_j(t_i)$ is the line fit of the dark part $j$ (before or after the burst) evaluated at time $t_i$. Doing so, the subtraction $n_2(t_2) - n_1(t_1)$ gives the raw height of the burst step in the charge sequence\footnote{Moreover, doing the subtraction removes systematics inaccuracy coming from the Keithley electrometer.} while the terms in brackets remove the averaged contribution of the dark current using both the dark times before and after the burst. The uncertainties from all line parameters are then propagated to quote the measurement of the charge measured with the photodiode. They are typically of the order of the residual RMS, around \SI{5e-5}{\nano\coulomb}, more than 3 orders of magnitude below the typical $\Delta q_{\rm mes}$ values.

\subsubsection{Solar cell data reduction overview}

\subsubsection{Spectrograph data reduction overview}

The spectrograph exposure times were set to not reach its saturation level for all wavelengths. However, the sampling rate was not tunable and time stamps unavailable. So we just take as much spectra as we can during an acquisition, and then analyse them. Some contains laser light, other are darks. We assume a spectrum is a dark if they are no spectrograph pixel above its median plus a threshold. To set the threshold, we first compute the RMS per spectrograph wavelength using all the spectra. Then the threshold is the minimum value between either 20\% of the maximum RMS at any wavelength or 20 times the median value of all the RMS values. This setting allows use to detect small and high laser lines, and flag as dark the spectra that do not contain them.

After this repartition of the spectra in two categories, we subtract a bias level and compute a master dark frame doing the median of all the dark spectra. This master dark is subtracted to all spectra. This removes the spectrograph baseline and hot pixels. The spectra containing laser line are them stacked to increase signal to noise ratio of the line and of the contaminations.

Then we use the \texttt{Spectractor} software to detect emission lines and fit their centroids. We searched for the laser line of course, but also lines at \SI{532}{\nm} and from two photon conversions. Indeed, we noticed the presence of a \SI{532}{\nm} line in the regime 532 to \SI{669}{\nm}, and of a weak line when the laser is set to wavelength above \SI{1064}{\nm}. If we call $\lambda_L$ the laser wavelength, we observed the production of photons at wavelength $\lambda_h$ given by
\begin{equation}
 \frac{2}{\SI{1064}{\nm}} = \frac{1}{\lambda_L} + \frac{1}{\lambda_h}
 \end{equation} 
due to the conversion of two \SI{1064}{\nm} photons into a laser photon at $\lambda_L$ and a complementary photon at $\lambda_h$ that ended in the laser beam. In practice, we observed a small emission line in the spectrograph when $\lambda_L > \SI{1064}{\nm}$, nearly symmetrical of the laser line with respect to \SI{1064}{\nm}. An example of a stacked spectra with the detection of the laser line at \SI{643}{\nm} and the pump line at \SI{532}{\nm} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:spectro_reduc_643}.

\end{figure}


Using \texttt{Spectractor} and the spectrograph calibration, we then have the true laser wavelength at the Angstrom level. Indeed the realised wavelength is never the one a priori asked, as one can see in Figure~\ref{fig:sc_dataset_examples}. However, we observed a remarkable repeatability of the correspondence between the set wavelength and the realised wavelength (see Figure~\ref{fig:wavelength_stability}). Therefore, in most figures of this paper we use the set laser wavelength.
